<p>Dear Dr. <%= @last_name %>, </p>

<p>I would like to ask you to login and review and update your <%= link_to("Cancer Center LatticeGrid profile", @profile_url) %>. 
You currently have <%= @pub_valid %> publications that are available in your profile, 
and <%= (@pub_total-@pub_valid) %> that may be your publications but have not been reviewed or approved.</p>

<p>The URLs for reviewing and approving are here:</p>
<ul>
Login: <%= link_to(@login_url, @login_url) %><br/> 
Publications: <%= link_to(@edit_publications_url, @edit_publications_url) %><br/>
Profile: <%= link_to(@edit_profile_url, @edit_profile_url) %><br/>
Your public LatticeGrid page: <%= link_to(@profile_url, @profile_url) %>
</ul>

<% if @abstract.blank? %>
<p>Your current public research summary is blank. That means that your Cancer Center research statement is blank on both LatticeGrid 
and the Cancer Center web site.Please update your profile and include a research statement.</p>
<% else %>
<p>Your current public research statement, available both in LatticeGrid and the Cancer Center web site, is included below:</p>

<ul>
<%= @abstract %>
</ul>

<p>To update this research statement please go to <%= link_to(@edit_profile_url, @edit_profile_url) %>.</p>

<% end %>

<p>With kind regards,</p>
