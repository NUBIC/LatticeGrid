# Once you have your environment configured, that is, Ruby is installed, Ruby Gems is installed, Rails is installed, 
# PostgreSQL is installed, and you have moved LatticeGrid into an appropriate home directory (appropriate based on 
#  your server configuration policies that is) you can run the following commands. Please note I have provided the 
#  development version of the commands as well as the production version.

# test that the database can be dropped, created, and models can be generated and moved into Postgres:
rake db:drop
rake db:create
rake db:migrate

# reverse the migration
   rake db:migrate VERSION=0
# repeat
    rake db:migrate

# do it in production:
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate

# do it in test:
rake environment RAILS_ENV=test db:migrate

#RUN TESTS

ruby test/unit/abstract_test.rb
# see some testing issues for Rails 2.2+ here: http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/djcp/2009/01/rails-22-postgres-and-testing/

# install  investigators using ldap
#example:
rake getLDAP uid_list=aqw,wakibbe

# you will need to load your list of departments, programs, etc into these files. 
#load organizations
rake importDepartments file=db/imports/department_lookup.txt
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production importDepartments file=db/imports/department_lookup.txt

rake importOrganizations file=db/imports/division_lookup.txt
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production importOrganizations file=db/imports/division_lookup.txt

# sets any missing division_ids appropriately
rake cleanUpOrganizations
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production cleanUpOrganizations

# you can load the investigators in a migration file, which might have entries that look like this:
Investigator.create :username => "str", :last_name => "Rosen", :first_name => "Steven", :middle_name => "T",  :pubmed_search_name => "Rosen S T", :email => "s-rosen@northwestern.edu"
# note that you must have a unique username for each entry

#You can insert investigator names from a file, as per

rake importInvestigators file=db/imports/faculty.txt
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production importInvestigators file=db/imports/faculty.txt
# or 
rake importInvestigators file=db/imports/UCSFMembers.txt
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production importInvestigators file=db/imports/UCSFMembers.txt
# or 
rake importInvestigators file=db/imports/cinj_faculty.txt
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production importInvestigators file=db/imports/cinj_faculty.txt

# build the investigator/program relationships. Use the following file as an example
rake importProgramMembership  file=db/imports/RHLCCCProgramMemberships.txt
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production importProgramMembership  file=db/imports/RHLCCCProgramMemberships.txt

#insert ISI Web of Science Journal impact factor ratings

rake importJournalImpact file=db/imports/jcr_recs.txt
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production importJournalImpact file=db/imports/jcr_recs.txt

# clean all usernames by removing any periods
rake cleanInvestigatorsUsername
rake environment RAILS_ENV=production cleanInvestigatorsUsername

# you are now ready to start loading data
