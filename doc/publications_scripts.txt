vacuumdb -fz latticegrid_development
# to run as the rails user
vacuumdb -fz latticegrid_development -U latticegrid
# to run as the rails user in production
vacuumdb -fz latticegrid_production -U latticegrid
# vacuum the remote db
vacuumdb -fz latticegrid_production -U latticegrid -h pdev

# logging in to psql
psql latticegrid_development -U latticegrid
