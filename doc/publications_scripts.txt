# if you have the current user set up as superuser:
vacuumdb -fz latticegrid_development
# to run as the rails user
vacuumdb -fz latticegrid_development -U latticegrid
# to run as the rails user in production
vacuumdb -fz latticegrid_production -U latticegrid

# logging in to psql
psql latticegrid_development -U latticegrid
psql latticegrid_production -U latticegrid
