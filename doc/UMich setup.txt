# verify that /etc/nubic/db/aker-prod.yml has the necessary config. Should look like:

  database: umich_latticegrid_development
  username: latticegrid

# setup the database. This assumes you are running in development 
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
#import the programs
rake importDepartments file=db/imports/UMich/department_lookup.txt
rake importOrganizations file=db/imports/UMich/division_lookup_20110809.txt
# check that all is ok. 
rake cleanUpOrganizations
# see if programs have changed. Following is not necessary unless you are using an existing installation of latticegrid and have removed/changed programs
rake getAllOrganizationsNotUpdated
rake purgeUnupdatedOrganizations
# import the investigators
rake importInvestigators file=db/imports/UMich/faculty_20110809.txt
# check that you have the counts you are expecting!
rake getAllMembers  
rake getAllInvestigatorsWithoutMembership  

# now ready to populate
rake insertAllAbstracts

# run the whole smear
#all the expected tasks are run using this build command
# runs these tasks: :insertAbstracts, :updateAbstractInvestigators, :buildCoauthors, :updateInvestigatorInformation, :updateOrganizationAbstractInformation
rake nightlyBuild
# once a month (or after a number of nightly builds) run monthlyBuild
# monthlyBuild runs these tasks:  :tagAbstractsWithMeshTerms, :tagInvestigatorsWithMeshTerms, :attachMeshInformationContent, :buildInvestigatorColleaguesMesh, :normalizeInvestigatorColleaguesMesh

rake monthlyBuild

# all of these tasks can be done on production like this:

rake RAILS_ENV=production monthlyBuild
