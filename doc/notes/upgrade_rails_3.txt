Following

  http://x-aeon.com/wp/2012/12/19/migrating-big-applications-from-rails-2-to-rails-3/#MRAFR2TR3_First


updated files as described above and tried to start the rails app
  ./script/rails server


First issue:
  Had to update the config/initializers/date_formats.rb file as
  ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions has been removed. Not a big issue.


First big hurdle:

  NoMethodError: undefined method `money_precision='

  Looks like the acts_as_tsearch plugin will not work with Rails 3.

  To get past this I updated the postgresql_adapter.rb file as described in the lighthouseapp ticket above
  ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327@lattice_grid/gems/activerecord-3.2.15/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb
