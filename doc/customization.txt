In addition to the data configuration, you will undoubtedly want to configure the look and feel of LatticeGrid 
for your organization. To do that, you will want, at a minimum, to modify these files:

config/database.yml : sets the database connection strings
db/imports/department_lookup.txt : list of your schools, departments
db/imports/division_lookup.txt : list of your programs and divisions
db/imports/faculty.txt : list of your faculty. You can also include them as a migration script if you prefer. You 
	can also include a 'Program' column listing the program association for each member. Include multiple identical 
	rows (except for the Program name of course!) to load multiple programs for an investigator.
db/imports/programmemberships.txt : list of your faculty and their memberships in your centers
lib/config.rb : sets the menu headings, default school name, email subject line, and curl task urls
lib/ldap_config.rb : sets whether or not to use ldap, and your local ldap names. 
lib/ldap_utilities.rb : You may also need to change the mappings between the LatticeGrid column names and your ldap records
lib/pubmed_config.rb : sets the pubmed search defaults and institution string for your install
