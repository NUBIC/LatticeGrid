Show LatticeGrid

the various visualizations

and then the database schema 

and the associations of the models

* Investigator
* OrganizationalUnit
* Abstract
* Proposal
* Study
* WordFrequency

* InvestigatorAbstract
* InvestigatorColleague
* InvestigatorProposal
* InvestigatorStudy
* OrganizationAbstract

and how the data is setup

then let's look at the visualization libraries
* cytoscapeweb/cytoscapejs
* protovis/d3
* graphviz
* fusioncharts

drill back into the cytoscape visualizations
  that the flash player and js is handling the several  
  different types of visualizations (force directed, radial, etc.)

go to the examples page for cytoscapeweb 
  and show the similarities to the front end in LatticeGrid

then show the data source and how it is created from the models
  simply call out to the json data source and then look 
  quickly at the generator source to see what it is doing

  look at the specs

now let's do the same thing for the chord graph 
  go to the examples page in d3 for the chord diagram
  and show the similarties to the front end

then show the data source and how it is created from the models
  simply call out to the json data source and then look 
  quickly at the generator source to see what it is doing

  look at the specs

and then the wordle
  go to the examples page in d3 for the layout diagram
  and show the similarties to the front end

then show the data source and how it is created from the models
  simply call out to the json data source and then look 
  quickly at the generator source to see what it is doing

  look at the specs
