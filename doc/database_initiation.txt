-- LatticeGrid uses PostgreSQL. Download it here: http://www.postgresql.org/
-- AFAIK there aren't any version specific issues for LatticeGrid other than those of the ruby drivers

-- connecting to a remote postgres server:

psql -h pstage rhlccc_latticegrid -U rhlccc

--PostgreSQL commands

-- add this line to pg_hba.conf so you can connect to it on the local machine without a password, if you so desire

local  all    latticegrid   trust

-- now login to postgres using psql

psql postgres

-- create the user (role)
-- for a little bit of security, create a role. user is an alias for role that also specifies that the role is permitted to login

CREATE USER latticegrid with createdb;
ALTER USER latticegrid with superuser;
ALTER USER latticegrid with login;

#if you need to add the createdb role to user, do it like this:
ALTER USER latticegrid with createdb;

-- you can also specify a user and password:

CREATE USER latticegrid WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4';
-- or if the user has already been created:
ALTER USER latticegrid WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4';


-- or add a end date to the user:

CREATE ROLE latticegrid WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4' VALID UNTIL '2008-01-01';


-- now switch to the new user

\connect - latticegrid


-- now create the database

create database latticegrid_development;
create database cinj_latticegrid_staging;
create database latticegrid_test;
create database latticegrid_production;
create database fsm_latticegrid;

# You can also use the shell script but this requires looser security, specifying access, or reassigning ownership of the database

createdb latticegrid_development
createdb latticegrid_test

# now edit the database.yml file:

config/database.yml : sets the database connection strings

development:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: latticegrid_development
  username: latticegrid

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: latticegrid_test
  username: latticegrid

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: latticegrid_production
  username: latticegrid

# using postgres pg_dump

pg_dump -i -Fc ucsfcancerpublications_development -U ucsfcancerpublications > ucsfpublications_dev_20110308.dmp
