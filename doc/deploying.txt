To deploy using capistrano (http://www.capistranorb.com) you first need to configure
the deployment. The latticegrid deployment uses bcdatabase (https://github.com/NUBIC/bcdatabase)
for configuration to allow a user to deploy more than one instance of the application
on the same server. So a deployer would use the following command:

$ LATTICEGRID_INSTANCE=rhlccc bundle exec cap staging deploy

A file named LATTICEGRID_INSTANCE_latticegrid_deploy.yml should be placed in the
deployer's bcdatabase directory (/etc/nubic/db by default) with these items:

latticegrid:
  application: 'APP_NAME'
  repo: 'https://github.com/NUBIC/LatticeGrid.git'
  deploy_to: '/var/www/apps/APP_NAME'
  staging_app_server: 'staging.application.server'
  production_app_server: 'production.application.server'
  server_user: 'DEPLOYER'
