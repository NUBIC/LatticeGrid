Understanding the control of cell division and the relationship between proliferation and differentiation has profound implications for the development and behavior of tumors in the central nervous system.  Although the mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation during neural development are poorly understood, data suggests that loss of normal cell polarity and tissue architecture play crucial regulatory roles in cell proliferation and cancer.  Research from the Chenn lab suggests that beta-catenin can regulate cell cycle re-entry and differentiation in the developing mammalian brain, as transgenic mice expressing a stabilized beta-catenin develop massively enlarged brains.  Loss of function studies indicate that beta catenin is required for cell proliferation in normal development and suggest that beta catenin misregulation may underlie tumor growth in the central nervous system. Dr. Chenn is a 2003 recipient of a V Foundation for Cancer Research grant for his work on ""Mechanisms of beta-Catenin in Cancer and Brain Development and a recipient of the Sontag Foundation Distinguished Scientist Award for brain cancer research.  Dr. Chenn is also a Searle Scholar has received funding from the American Cancer Society, Illinois and the NIH."Gross	Adrian	MD	agr714	Harris	Ann	PhD	aha385	Schaeffer	Anthony	MD	ajs351	"<p>Dr. Schaeffer is the Chair of the Department of Urology.

The proteasome plays a central role in cellular regulation by controlling the concentrations of hundreds of regulatory proteins, removing misfolded proteins, and producing some peptides displayed in antigen presentation.  The immediate goal of the Matouschek lab is to understand how the unfolding step affects the specificity of the proteasome for its substrates and how it affects the nature of its degradation products.  The research has discovered a novel step in the substrate targeting mechanism and described previously unknown rules that contribute to the specificity of degradation of natural proteins.  The work has also identified a signal that leads to the proteasome degrading only part of a substrate protein in a process called processing.  The signal and the resulting processing explains key steps in the regulation of transcriptions NF_B and Cubitus interruptus.  The Matouschek lab is now characterizing the biochemical mechanism of processing and determining whether processing is a more widely used regulatory mechanism in the cell.  This work is relevant to cancer and many of the proteins degraded by the proteasome regulate cell growth and division.  Since proteins must be unfolded before they are cleaved by the proteasome, understanding unfolding during degradation may open new avenues to fight cancer, for example by stabilizing specific proteins against unfolding and degradation."Minella	Alexander C	MD	ama702	Evens	Andrew	"DO, MS"	ame340	"<p>Dr. Evens' research interests focus on the development and study of novel experimental therapies for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease.

Dr. Gonzalez's work has provided support for the notion that the alpha4 laminin subunit (a4LN), a component of the basement membrane secreted by endothelial cells, is crucial for blood vessel development through a novel interaction with alphavbeta3 integrin. Moreover, she has found that that there is crosstalk between alpha1 containing integrins and the alphavbeta3 integrin heterodimer in endothelial cells and that such crosstalk regulates the affinity of alphavbeta3 integrin for the a4LN subunit while a PKA inhibitor abrogates the crosstalk. The laboratory is currently examining the molecular mechanisms regulating the affinity of alphavbeta3 integrin for the a4LN subunit, and will determine whether specific serine/threonine phosphorylation events on the cytoplasmic tails of alphavbeta3 integrin negatively regulate the affinity of alphavbeta3 integrin for a4LN. The laboratory also studies the role of apoptosis in tube-like network assembly of endothelial cells. Together these studies will provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate angiogenesis and, long term, may uncover useful reagents that can block tumor development by inhibiting their ability to develop a vasculature."Anderson	Wayne F.	PhD	anderw	"<p>As one of the members of the NIH funded Midwest Center for Structural Genomics, the Anderson lab is involved in developing methods for high-throughput structure determination and in the application of these methods to the determination of increasingly challenging macromolecular structures. One product of the NIH Protein Structure Initiative is a dramatic expansion of the protein structure database. Areas of interest include molecular mechanisms of metabolic regulation, the structural basis of the regulation of gene expression, and the prevention and repair of DNA damage, all of which are relevant to cancer biology. The structures of proteins that are potential drug targets and their complexes with small molecule ligands now play an important role as an aid in drug discovery. Methodology for high throughput structure determination and the characterization of protein-ligand complexes will make X-ray crystallography an increasingly useful tool for drug discovery. An important related activity is the development of facilities that will be available for Northwestern investigators to carry out structural studies at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron at Argonne National Laboratory."Omary	Reed	"MD, MS"	aor766	Paller	Amy	MD	apaller	"<p>Dr. Paller's laboratory has shown that gangliosides, which are glycosphingolipids of the cell membrane, impact several biologic processes and signaling pathways of normal keratinocytes and the squamous carcinoma cells in vitro. These cell functions, (e.g., proliferation, survival, and adhesion, spreading, and migration on a fibronectin matrix) involve activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and a5_1 integrin, and are critical for cancer cell function. Caveolin-1-containing signaling domains in membranes are sites of coupling of receptors and signaling molecules. Dr. Paller's laboratory has shown that specific gangliosides co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin-1 and receptors, including a5_1 and the EGFR, suggesting that gangliosides affect caveolin-1 mediated signaling in squamous carcinoma cells. The laboratory has demonstrated that ganglioside GM3 shifts caveolin-1 from detergent-insoluble domains into detergent-soluble domains in proximity with the EGFR. Given the known inhibitory effect of caveolin-1 on the EGFR, this finding suggests that ganglioside may serve as a shuttle molecule to facilitate caveolin-1 interaction with receptors. These in vitro studies have been extended to mouse tumor models, in which gene modulation of ganglioside expression has been shown to alter the proliferative and apoptotic potential of squamous cell carcinomas. The laboratory is currently evaluating the effects of endogenous ganglioside modulation on carcinogenesis and wound healing in vivo using a transgenic mouse model of epidermis-specific ganglioside depletion."Mazar	Andrew	PhD	apm680	Rosenzweig	Amy	PhD	aro764	"<p>The goal of Dr. Rosenzweig's research program is to understand metalloprotein function on the molecular level by using X-ray crystallographic, biophysical, and biochemical techniques.

In the metal trafficking area, she is focusing on the Wilson disease protein and homologs. Recently, this copper transporting ATPase has been shown to be upregulated in cells resistant to the anticancer drug cisplatin. She is working to understand how these ATPases bind and transport metal ions on the molecular level. In the metalloenzyme area, Dr. Rosenzweig is working on ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) from both yeast and E. coli.

He uses multi-electrode physiological methods in the non-human research and Magnetic Resonance (MR) techniques in humans. In normal subjects, he is using functional MR imaging to characterize the brain network underlying pain perception and identifying pathophysiological changes in this network for various clinical pain syndromes. To this end, the work has concentrated in devising methodologies that can be used across the spectrum of clinical pain syndromes. Another direct extension of these studies is determining the effects of various therapies on the cortical network for pain. Currently, Apkarian is the PI of two NIH/NINDS R01s and another NIH/NINDS R21. Current work has developed a number of brain biomarkers that define chronic pain states in humans and that indicate that chronic pain induces cortical reorganization. Based on these human studies, Apkarian's group has been investigating cellular and molecular mechanisms of the impact of chronic pain on the cortex in rodent models. The results of the latter studies point to specific prefrontal circuitry and specific receptor site as a critical link for chronic pain behavior. These studies revealed new potential therapeutics that show efficacy in controlling cancer chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain in rats."Heinemann	Allen	PhD	awh	"<p>Dr. Heinemann he been on faculty at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC) where he directs the Center for Rehabilitation Outcomes Research, a rehabilitation-focused health services research unit.

These are chromatin-associated proteins that play a role in gene regulation and include p400 (a transcription regulatory protein), p300/CBP (two highly homologous transcriptional co-activators and histone acetyl transferases), PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor) and the pocket family proteins pRb, p107 and p130.  Thimmapaya laboratory focuses on the consequences of E1A interactions with the these cellular proteins on cell cycle G1-S transition, cell cycle progression, and cell transformation. His laboratory recently showed when p300 is depleted in quiescent cells, c-Myc and S phase are induced, and the induction of S phase is dependent on c-Myc induction.  Similarly, in cells capable of conditionally over-expressing p300, serum-stimulated induction of c-Myc and S phase are repressed.  In quiescent cells, repression of gene expression by p300 is specific for c-Myc (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003, 100:9524).  Depletion of CBP in quiescent cells also leads to the same effect, and surprisingly, cells that enter S phase do not complete cell cycle but stop at mid S phase and then apoptose suggesting that normal levels of both p300 and CBP are essential for c-Myc repression in quiescent cells, and the normal levels of both these proteins are also necessary for cell cycle progression.  In other studies, Thimmapaya laboratory also showed that E1A induces c-Myc and S phase in quiescent cells only when it binds to p300 and Rb; binding to p400 is not linked to c-Myc induction or S phase.  Thus, one of the consequences of E1A interaction with the p300 and Rb is to induce c-Myc that is critical for G1-S transition and cell transformation. These studies have broad implication in DNA tumor virus biology, in that one or more virus-encoded tumor antigens may induce c-Myc by binding to and inactivating the chromatin associated protein complexes."B.

Dr. Hoffman has found that porphyrin analogues, called porphyrazines, possess the required intense, long-wavelength absorption needed for optical imaging. In addition, it is well established that porphyrinic macrocycles tend to localize in neoplastic tissue, and such a characteristic in these new compounds would place them in a unique position to serve as breast-tumor imagers.  Recent work has shown that optical imaging of breast tumors holds great promise of offering an effective, safe, noninvasive and inexpensive breast-tumor imaging modality. Tissue does not absorb light at wavelengths beyond the absorbance of hemoglobin, ~ 750 nm, as can be seen by holding a flashlight up to one's hand.  Considerable progress has been made in developing the technologies to reconstruct an image from the many photons of long-wavelength light that scatter and the relatively few •ballisticê photons that make it straight through the tissue.  Just as with other imaging modalities, tumor images would be greatly enhanced and sharpened by the use of contrast agents that absorb the wavelength of light employed.  Most beneficial would be contrast agents that (i) localize in neoplastic tissue, and thereby highlight the tumors; (ii) absorb strongly at long wavelengths not absorbed by the surrounding, healthy tissue. The porpyhrazines developed by Dr. Hoffman's interdisciplinary group meet many of these criteria."Mittal	Bharat	MD	bmi218	"Dr. Bharat Mittal's research interest focuses on the use of combined modality         therapy for the treatment of Head and Neck Cancers and Hematologic malignancies.         He participates in studies from various Natioanl Coperative groups like         RTOG and ECOG.

These proliferative, migratory, tissue invasive stem cells undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at a key stage in their development, and migrate extensively to populate target tissues throughout the embryo.  A number of proteins that control key aspects of normal neural crest development are misregulated neural crest derived tumors, therefore examining the regulatory programs that control the normal development of neural crest cells can provide important insight into how such programs are inappropriately reactivated during tumorigenesis.  Dr. LaBonne's laboratory actively studies these links, with neuroblastoma and melanoma as a major focus of study. Moreover, as it has become increasingly clear that the mechanisms that control developmental and pathological EMT's are highly conserved, the neural crest has emerged as an important in vivo model system for understanding the cellular and molecular events underlying this process during tumor progression.  Dr. LaBonne's laboratory studies the function and posttranslational regulation of two classes of transcription factors, Snail family repressors, and Twist-related activators, that are key molecular regulators of EMTs in both neural crest development and in tumor progression. Dr. LaBonne's group also collaborates with Dr. Meade in the Department of Chemistry on the characterization of novel cobalt (III) Schiff base compounds designed to interfere with Snail function, and in evaluating the therapeutic potential of these agents as inhibitors of pathological EMTs and tumor cell invasiveness."Clevenger	Charles	"MD, PhD"	ccl754	"<p>Dr. Clevenger has been recruited from University of Pennsylvania and is also a leader of the Breast Cancer Program of the RHLCCC of the Northwestern University.  The research focus in Dr. Clevenger's lab is the characterization of prolactin (PRL) receptor signal transduction and function as it pertains to breast cancer and mammary gland development. The PRL receptor (PRLr) is a member of the growth factor/cytokine receptor family, which includes the receptors for interleukin 2-7, GM-CSF, erythropoietin, and growth hormone. Within humans, PRL functions at the endocrine and autocrine/paracrine levels as a growth and differentiation factor within the breast, a hypothesis first postulated by Dr. Clevenger's laboratory. Indeed, recent data from Dr. Clevenger's laboratory have also demonstrated that PRL serves as a chemoattractant for human breast carcinoma. Therefore, one of Dr. Clevenger's major aims is the characterization of those mechanisms that regulate PRL/PRLr expression and action in both normal and neoplastic tissues. PRL action in human tissues is mediated by six prolactin receptor isoforms, three of which were initially identified and characterized by Dr. Clevenger's laboratory lab. In addition to these non-genomic transduction pathways mediated by PRL via its interaction with JAK/Stat, Vav2/Rac, Dr. Clevenger's laboratory has recently identified a direct genomic action of PRL on gene expression. As such, Dr. Clevenger's findings present vantage points in the development of novel therapies aimed at modulating PRL action during the differentiation of the human breast and the pathogenesis of malignancy in this tissue."Cheng	Chonghui	"MD, PhD"	cct810	Gottardi	Cara	PhD	cgo790	"<p>Dr. Gottardi's research centers on understanding mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion and how adhesive information is conveyed to the cell's interior. Research is focused on the cytoplasmic protein, beta (b)-catenin, which plays essential roles in both intercellular adhesion and nuclear signaling. At the cell surface, b-catenin binds the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin-type adhesion receptors, which allows cells to engage their neighbors through robust intercellular adhering junctions. In the cytoplasm and nucleus, a cadherin-independent pool of b-catenin transduces extracellular Wnt signals by interacting with TCF-type transcription factors to activate target genes. What precisely controls b-catenin targeting to cadherin-based adhesive, or TCF-transcription complexes is not well-understood. This question is important since b-catenin that is bound to the cadherin exhibits tumor suppressor activity, while b-catenin that is bound to TCF exhibits oncogenic activity. Thus, understanding how b-catenin is targeted to adhesive or signaling complexes will be a crucial first step towards considering strategies that seek to inhibit the oncogenic, but not the tumor suppressor activity of b-catenin."Chandel	Navdeep	PhD	cha994	"<p>Dr. Chandel's laboratory is interested in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and apoptosis in response to oxygen deprivation. The growth of solid tumors requires an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. Tumor cells tend to proliferate at a rate that exceeds the supply of oxygen and nutrients provided by blood vessels and are therefore limited in size. Accordingly, tumor cells starved for oxygen (hypoxia) release factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. As tumor cells await angiogenesis to replenish deprived oxygen and nutrients, conditions develop where apoptosis may occur in response to a lack of oxygen and glucose. The Lab focuses on two questions: 1. How do cells detect decreases in oxygen to activate angiogenesis? 2. Why do cells die in the absence of oxygen?"Chatterton	Robert	PhD	chat	"<p>Dr. Chatterton's primary research focus is on hormonal regulation of breast cancer susceptibility and growth.

The kinetics of estrogen and androgen metabolite formation is being studied as well as the retention of estrogenic metabolites of androgens such as 5-androstene-3beta,17 beta-diol. The lab continues to be involved in the fractionation and measurement of steroid hormones in nipple aspirate fluid and breast ductal lavage fluid as well as measurement of cytokines and growth factors that promote the biosynthesis of estrogens in the breast. In addition, targets of estrogen action, TFF-1, cathepsin D, and EGF, are measured in breast fluid to assess the effect of tamoxifen, raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors on estrogenic activity in the breast. These studies involve Dr. Seema Khan, who provides the breast fluid and breast biopsy tissues, and Dr. Michael Avram, who quantifies the drugs in serum and breast fluid by HPLC-Mass spectrometry.

In addition, due to their antiviral, antiproliferation, and immunomodulatory properties, including antitumor effects, interferons have been used for treatment of certain malignancies.  Treatment of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with interferons has been particularly encouraging, and combination therapies including IFN treatments are becoming more common.  In addition to their importance for cancer treatment, IFNs are also effective as antiviral therapies for chronic virus infections like Hepatitis C and HIV. Research in the Dr. Horvath's laboratory focuses on signal transduction and gene expression in mammalian cells with a focus on the INF pathway.  The goal of the research program is to understand the molecular events controlling inducible gene expression during innate immune responses to virus infections.  Several research projects in the laboratory are being pursued at the molecular, biochemical, and cell biological levels.  These projects can be subdivided into two major arenas that are complementary and cross-fertilizing:  (I) Regulation of the mammalian cellular antiviral response and  (II) Viral countermeasures that evolved to evade the host antiviral responses.  These two areas of investigation not only provide a rich milieu from which to glean basic insights into the molecular basis of gene regulation, signal transduction, and host pathogen interactions, but also serve to identify key factors that are potential targets for diagnostic or pharmaceutical intervention.  To date, the lab has characterized transcriptional co-activators essential for interferon mediated gene expression and one class of co-activators, protein deacetylase enzymes (HDACs), that are essential for interferon biosynthesis and antiviral responses.  In addition, several mechanisms by which RNA viruses evade the host antiviral response have been studied in biochemical detail, including those of medically important viruses like measles, mumps, human parainfluenza, and Nipah viruses.

She also noticed that students who do not palpate with a minimum level of pressure and frequency are less likely to generate an accurate diagnosis. Dr. Pugh is currently conducting similar research studies with breast and prostate simulators she developed. She is also working with the National Board of Medical Examiners to support the use of her simulators as assessment tools on the United States Medical Licensing Examination. Her long-term goals are to establish performance standards for clinical skills including cancer screening physical examinations."Stehlik	Christian	PhD	cst567	Thaxton	C.

Highlights of Dr. Cella's basic QOL measurement research include validation and translation of several subscales to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) measurement system, an instrument equating across five commonly-used QOL questionnaires (–Q-score project”), and most recently item banking and preparation for computerized adaptive testing using item response theory (IRT) based measurement. Dr. Cella is Principal Investigator of the NIH Roadmap initiative to develop a Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS; www.nihpromis.org), which includes a major emphasis in cancer including supplemental support from NCI. His accomplishments in descriptive studies of QOL during cancer survival include the survival period during treatment as well as off-treatment survivorship. He has contributed many papers to the literature in this area including manuscripts related to symptoms such as acute and chronic fatigue, neurotoxicity, impact of myelotoxicity upon function, and the general multidimensional impact of cancer and cancer treatment upon patient function and well being over time. Dr. Cella's contributions to analysis and interpretation of QOL data from clinical trials has bridged across many of the extant cooperative clinical trial groups in the United States and internationally.

He is also the Co-director of the Division of Reproductive Biology Research.  Alteration in steroid hormone and vitamin signaling pathways has tightly been linked to several forms of cancers including breast, prostate and ovarian cancers, and leukemia. The Chakravarti laboratory is interested in understanding the role and regulation of nuclear hormone receptor coactivator and corepressor functions. In this effort the Chakravarti laboratory made an original discovery and demonstrated that a novel SET-oncoprotein containing complex termed INHAT regulates chromatin modification and nuclear hormone receptor signaling including retinoid and estrogen receptor functions. In addition to SET being an oncoprotein, another subunit of the INHAT complex, the nuclear phosphoprotein pp32 has been linked to cell growth and prostate cancer. Following Dr. Chakravarti's original discovery, INHAT protein for the tumor suppressor protein p53 has also been identified by other groups further implying the role of INHAT activity in cell growth and cancer.  Finally, the Chakravarti laboratory has recently discovered and is currently characterizing members of the novel THAP family of proteins. Members of this novel family are expressed in a tissue selective manner. In particular Dr. Chakravarti's laboratory has recently reported that THAP7 is overexpressed in K562 leukemia cells indicating that dysregulation of THAP family of proteins might also contribute to cancer."Mohr	David C.

"MD, PhD"	dengman	"Trypanosomes are single-celled eukaryotic parasites that cause diseases         such as African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease. They have complex         life cycles involving insect and mammalian hosts and display a number         of unique features that make them powerful model organisms for the study         of genetics and molecular biology. The trypanosome genomes are approximately         50,000,000 bp in size and are organized in dozens to hundreds of linear         chromosomes. Nuclear gene expression in trypanosomes is unusual. With         few exceptions, there are no promotors and gene transcription does not         occur with discrete start and stop points. Rather, an entire chromosome         is transcribed in both directions from a single chromosome-internal initiation         point, and individual mRNAs are generated via polyadenylation and the         addition of a 39-nt spliced leader sequence to the 5' end of each coding         region. Mitochondrial gene expression is equally remarkable. A number         of mitochondrial genes are unidentifiable by DNA sequence, although the         corresponding mRNAs are normal and are translated into proteins participating         in a number of important mitochondrial processes. The ""nonsense"" genes         are transcribed into pre-mRNAs whose sequences are ""corrected"" via the         process of RNA editing: small antisense RNAs serve as templates for the         addition or deletion of uridine residues to the transcripts, which ultimately         results in mRNAs having intact coding sequences. <br><br> Research in Dr. David M.

Dr. Bentrem is interested in exploring the mechanisms of action of novel therapeutics for pancreatic cancer.  Despite attempts of curative resection and adjuvant therapy, pancreatic cancer continues to have a poor prognosis. Flavonoids have shown antitumor activity alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy in a number of solid malignancies. Apigenin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been shown to inhibit growth in some cancer cell lines but has not been studied in pancreatic cancer. The Bentrem laboratory hypothesizes that flavonoids could be used as either chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of pancreatic cancer.

She has identified and characterized several genes that are aberrantly regulated in highly invasive/metastatic breast cancer cells. In particular, lysyl oxidase (LOX) is up-regulated in highly invasive/metastatic breast cancer cells and in distant metastatic tumors from patients with breast cancer. LOX belongs to a family of copper-dependent amine oxidases that catalyze the oxidative deamination of peptidyl-lysine and hydroxylysine to reactive semialdehydes. Dr. Kirschman has determined that catalytically active LOX facilitates breast cancer cell motility by regulating cell-matrix adhesions through the FAK/src pathway. The mechanism by which LOX activates the src pathway (and subsequent cell motility) is mediated through the production of hydrogen peroxide; a by-product generated during regeneration of LOX catalytic activity. Our research continues to elucidate how LOX is regulated in breast cancer cells, potential protein binding partners and enzymatic targets of LOX in invasive/metastatic breast cancer cells, and the potential use of LOX as a prognostic/predictive biomarker for breast cancer metastasis."Singh	Diljeet K	"MD, PhD"	dks845	Shumkaer	Dale	PhD	dks980	Liang	Zhou	"MD, PhD"	dlinzer	"<p>Dr. Linzer's current research is focused on actions of placental hormones and cytokine regulation of hematopoiesis. A few years ago Dr. Linzer's laboratory discovered two hematopoietic cytokines that are placental hormones. Indeed, these cytokines are agonists that act synergistically with other cytokines, but do not simply duplicate the activities of these other factors. His laboratory has now shown that these placental cytokines act on mouse and human bone marrow cells - from the hematopoietic stem cell through all the myeloid lineages. These factors, and the signaling pathways that they induce, thus provide new opportunities to regulate hematopoietic cell growth, both in cases in which such cells become cancerous and in other cancers in which maintaining blood cell levels is essential for patient survival."Losordo	Douglas W.

GLI1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that was first identified as an amplified gene in a subset of malignant gliomas.  GLI1 is expressed in several human cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, sarcomas, and prostate carcinoma.  GLI1 is believed to play roles in the genesis of basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and sarcomas; in tumor progression of sarcomas, and in prostate cancer metastasis.  Dr. Walterhouse's laboratory is interested in mechanisms by which GLI family proteins, including GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 contribute to tumorigenesis. Transcription activation is believed to be the primary mechanism by which GLI1 contributes to cell transformation and whether other family members can transform cells is under investigation. His laboratory has identified VP-16-like transcription activation domains in GLI family proteins and is identifying specific co-activators that interact with these domains to activate transcription and/or to transform cells. Factors modulating GLI1 transcriptional regulatory activity including Protein Kinase A (PKA), an amino terminal transcriptional inhibitory domain, and the steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine are under investigation. The laboratory has identified downstream targets for GLI1 in the setting of cell transformation, linking GLI1 with cell cycle control.  The laboratory is now identifying GLI1 targets in human cancers, such as medulloblastoma and prostate carcinoma.  During a search for point mutations in glioma-derived GLI1, based on what appeared to be unique activating properties for glioma-derived GLI1, the laboratory identified polymorphisms in the human GLI1 gene and studies are ongoing to determine whether these polymorphisms carry clinical significance in terms of the risk of developing GLI1 related cancers.

Her work has demonstrated that combinations of transcription factors, of variable lineage specificity, interact with elements in myeloid genes to confer lineage and differentiation state specific gene expression. The interaction between these transcription factors is often regulated by the phosphorylation state of the factor. In particular, her current study is focused on homeobox (HOX) genes in myeloid leukemia.

The Sontheimer lab aims to understand the mechanisms of RNA-mediated steps during eukaryotic gene expression. Dr. Sontheimer's current research is focused on two important pathways: pre-mRNA splicing and RNA silencing. The machinery that removes introns from mRNA precursors is a large macromolecular complex called the spliceosome. Improper regulation of splicing has been shown to lead to certain forms of cancer.  Recently, a new role for RNA has been uncovered in eukaryotic gene expression: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules trigger the silencing of homologous genes in a phenomenon known as RNA interference (RNAi).  RNAi is an important control pathway that regulates the expression of cellular genes including oncogenes and protects cells from viruses and transposons.  It has also emerged as a broadly applicable experimental approach to determine the functions of novel genes. Finally, RNA silencing is being developed as a potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In collaboration with Richard Carthew, the Sontheimer lab is investigating the biochemical mechanism of RNAi."Weiss	Eric	PhD	elw264	"<p>Dr. Weiss's laboratory is interested in understanding how protein kinase signaling pathways coordinate cytoskeleton organization, membrane traffic, and gene expression to define cell architecture.  The Weiss lab's present work is concentrated on understanding the functions of p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and the Ndr/warts family kinase Cbk1. The PAKs and Cbk1 play important roles in the cell cycle.  Understanding how any protein kinase relays information requires identification of its regulatory partners and downstream phosphorylation targets.  The Weiss lab is taking diverse approaches to this difficult problem. In addition to well-established genetic and biochemical techniques, this group is applying novel chemical genetic methods for in vivo and in vitro characterization of individual protein kinase functions and targets.  The loss of normal cell architecture control is an important aspect of cancer progression, particularly in development of metastatic and invasive disease.  In a broad sense, Dr. Weiss's work will help determine how morphological control mechanisms work in normal cells and how these processes become deranged in cancer cells, which, in turn, will identify targets for therapeutic agents.  More specifically, Ndr/warts family protein kinases and associated proteins have recently emerged as an important link between cell proliferation control and morphogenesis."Marsh	Erica E.

Two human herpesviruses are associated with cancer (KSHV and EBV).  In addition, other human herpesviruses including HSV, VZV, and, CMV can cause significant disease in cancer patients with underlying defects in immune function.  The Smith laboratories research is focused on fundamental replication processes used by all herpesviruses to enter cells upon initial infection and to exit cells during the lytic phase of herpesvirus replication.  The major interest of the group is to determine the mechanisms by which herpesviruses co-opt cellular machinery necessary for transport of viral particles within cells. To this end, Dr. Smith has developed novel methods to image individual viral particles in living cells, both of neuronal and epithelial origin.  Since these features of herpesviruses replication are conserved across the family, Dr. Smith's research may result in the development of novel therapeutics directed at targets essential for either the entry or exit of herpesvirus from cells.  Finally, Dr. Smith's research may aide in the development of recombinant vectors to treat cancers of the nervous system."Dimri	Goberdhan	PhD	gdi570	"<p>Dr. Dimri's laboratory is interested in the role of polycomb group (PcG) proteins in cellular senescence and oncogenesis.  Dr. Dimri's study demonstrated that overexpression of a PcG protein, Bmi-1, in breast epithelial cells leads to induction of enzyme telomerase and cell immortalization. Further investigations are ongoing to examine the mechanism of Bmi-1 upregulation in tumors and cancer cell lines, the molecular basis of  telomerase induction of Bmi-1, and the mechanisms by which Bmi-1 cooperates with other oncogenes.  Furthermore, other PcG family members have non-overlapping functions in regulating senescence and oncogenesis; some members regulate p53-p21 pathway of senescence, while others regulate pRb-p16 pathway of senescence. These proteins cooperate in cellular transformation, affecting each other. Efforts are ongoing to develop reagents that can inhibit the function and/or expression of the diverse pro-oncogenic PcG proteins.

Within the nanocomposites DNA oligonucleotides retain base-pairing specificity, while the TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit photoreactivity. Moreover, TiO2 nanocomposites exhibit semiconducting properties through both constituentsãexcitation of TiO2 (exposure to electromagnetic radiation of energy above 3.2 eV) results in charge separation with accumulation of electrons in metal oxide and irreversible trapping of the electropositive holes in the sugar molecules of the DNA phosphodiester backbone leading to the cleavage of the DNA. She are currently developing these nanoparticles for cancer imaging and therapy. A second project in the laboratory involves understanding the role of the gene encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigen in radiation sensitivity. This work involves studies with the wasted mouse, a model which shows sensitivity to ionizing radiation, immunodeficiency, and motor neuron disease. A final component of the work in the laboratory involves studies of tissues from mice and dogs irradiated with various doses, dose-rates and qualities of ionizing radiation."Beitel	Greg	PhD	gjb871	"<p>Dr. Beitel's laboratory uses genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches with the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the mechanisms of vascular tube-size control and cell-cell junction organization. Both these areas have important implications for cancer because the ability to regulate vascular tube size could lead to a new class of anti-angiogenic based anti-cancer therapies and because many cell junction components have functions in cell polarity and growth control that are specifically disrupted in cancerous cells. In the area of tube-size control, the members of the Beitel lab have shown that a particular cell-cell junction which contains known tumor suppressor proteins has a critical role in controlling the size the tubes that delivers oxygen throughout the Drosophila embryo. The lab members have identified several new components of this junction and have shown that this junction is more closely related to human cell-cell junctions than was previous believed. Through collaborations with other labs, the Beitel lab is currently testing whether these proteins have conserved roles in vascular tube-size control or in establishing normal vertebrate cell junctions and polarity. In the area of cell-cell junction organization, the Beitel lab has initiated high throughput screens to identify the networks of interactions between particular protein-protein interaction domains that are prevalent among tumor suppressor and cell signaling proteins. These screens will be done for both the human and Drosophila proteomes, with the experimental manipulability of Drosophila allowing for rapid in vivo validation of conserved interactions. Confirmed interactions will be further analyzed in vertebrate models. Understanding these networks should identify multiple therapeutic intervention strategies to limit the growth of tumor cells."Gamble	Gail L.

It has been observed that routine use of the combination estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pill (OCP) confers a remarkable 30-50 percent reduction in the risk of developing subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting that an effective cancer preventive approach using contraceptive hormones is possible. They have discovered that the progestin component of OCPs markedly activates well-known cancer preventive molecular pathways such as apoptosis and TGF-beta in the ovarian epithelium. In an analysis of data from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study of a large case-control study with approximately 400 women with ovarian cancer and 3,000 matched controls, the team demonstrated that use of a progestin-potent OCP is twice as protective against ovarian cancer as use of a progestin-weak OCP. In fact, use of a progestin-potent oral contraceptive pill for less than 18 months was sufficient to lower the subsequent risk of ovarian cancer by more than 60 percent."Kansas	Geoffrey	PhD	gsk116	"<p>The Kansas laboratory focuses on two distinct areas of investigation. The first concerns the signaling and transcriptional pathways that control the expression of carbohydrate ligands for selectins on activated T cells. Selectins are carbohydrate-binding adhesion molecules which control the interaction of leukocytes with other leukocytes, platelets, and the endothelium, and as such are critically involved in inflammation, development and cancer metastasis. The Kansas group has defined roles for the transcription factors Stat4 and T-bet, and the major signaling molecule Ras, in controlling the expression of key glycosyltransferases responsible for selectin ligand biosynthesis. The second major area is the developmental biology of plasma cells, terminally differentiated B cells responsible for production of antibody. Dr. Kansas has recently shown that the Stat3 transcription factor is essential for the differentiation of IgG B cells to plasma cells. Remarkably, Stat3 plays no essential role prior to plasma cell development. He is now working to understand why Stat3 is nonredundantly requisite for IgG B cells but not for other isotypes. Based in part on these studies, and in part on the finding of active Stat3 in myeloma cells, additional efforts are directed toward production of a mouse model of myeloma, using constitutively active mutants of Stat3."Yang	Guang-Yu	"MD, PhD"	gya826	"<p>Dr. Yang is surgical pathologist whose research interests are in the molecular mechanisms and chemoprevention of chronic inflammation-driven carcinogenesis using ulcerative colitis as a model.

They have developed a novel chronic inflammation driven carcinogenesis mouse model without using carcinogens (dextran sulfate sodium induced and dietary iron enhanced ulcerative colitis-associated carcinogenesis) which provides a basis for studying the molecular mechanisms and chemoprevention of chronic inflammation-driven carcinogenesis. The group also studies the chemopreventive effects and related molecular targets of antioxidants, N-acetylcystein, COX-2 inhibitor/s, and inositol compounds.

In collaboration with Dr. Kaul, an assay for testing this mutation in archival material was developed and testing is ongoing on tumor blocks and slides of those who have died of colon cancer. Future studies will include an exploration of Ashkenazi families with colorectal cancer to determine whether the I1307K mutation may be associated with other malignancies as some preliminary findings suggest.

(2) Analysis of the role of adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in cell death and survival. ANT is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein. Its role in cellular protection and death is also controversial. (3) Hexokinases and mitochondrial integrity. Hexokinases bind to the mitochondrial membrane and prevent translocation of pro-apoptotic molecules (such as Bax) into the mitochondria.  The long-term goal of these studies is to better understand cellular metabolic changes that are associated with apoptotic responses.  These studies should provide unique information about cancer cells protected against apoptosis."Folsch	Heike	PhD	hfo171	"<p>Dr. Folsch's research interests are to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in establishment and maintenance of cellular polarity as loss of polarity is a prerequisite of metastatic cancer derived from epithelial cells.  Work in the Folsch lab centers around the epithelial-specific clathrin-adaptor complex AP-1B, which plays a pivotal role in basolateral delivery of transmembrane proteins along the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways.  Currently the lab focuses on the molecular mechanisms of vesicle formation and fusion. This research encompasses the analysis of mutant forms of AP-1B and small GTPases such as Rab13 and Arf6, which regulate the AP-1B pathway.  By better understanding the process by which epithelial cells maintain polarity, the lab will shed light on how epithelial cells become depolarized in metastatic cancer."Munshi	Hidayatullah	MD	hgm988	"<p>One of the projects in Dr Munshi's lab focuses on understanding the role of fibrosis in pancreatic cancer progression. Fibrosis, also known as desmoplastic reaction, is a very prominent feature of almost all human pancreatic tumors, and earlier reports suggested that this desmoplasia in fact contributed to pancreatic cancer progression. Dr. Munshi's group recently demonstrated that the pancreatic cancer cells adjacent to the areas of fibrosis exhibit increased expression of a key protease, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). The goal of this project is to understand how the desmoplastic reaction increases the expression of MT1-MMP in the cancer cells, thus enabling the pancreatic cancer cells to invade through a collagen-rich extracellular matrix. Since Dr. Munshi's research has shown that the desmoplastic reaction can induce TGF-_1 expression by pancreatic cells, current studies are aimed at understanding the detailed signaling pathways involved in matrix-mediated TGF-_1 expression. Additionally, the lab is also examining how TGF-_1 regulates MT1-MMP expression, in particular focusing on the role of Snail family of transcription factors. Finally, in collaboration with Dr Paul Grippo, Dr. Munshi has also begun experiments using transgenic mice to examine the contribution of MT1-MMP to tumor formation and progression in the in vivo pancreatic microenvironment."Kamp	David	MD	hidk	"<p>Dr. Kamp is Professor Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.

His laboratory also creates genetically engineered mouse models including models for breast cancer. They discovered that the G1-cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 is dispensable for proliferation; however, CDK4 is essential for transformation.  CDK4-knockout mice are resistant to HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis.  The laboratory also found that cellular expression levels of CDC25A, which is a CDK activator, determine the rate of transformation.  Downregulating CDC25A upon DNA damage is critical for checkpoint.  Transgenic mice overexpressing CDC25A exhibit higher sensitivity to HER2/neu-induced tumorigenesis, while CDC25A heterozygous knockout mice display a marked delay in HER2/neu-induced tumorigenesis.  These studies provide insights into therapeutic intervention targeted on the cell cycle machinery."Li	Honglin	PhD	hli958	Holmgren	Robert	PhD	holmgren	"<p>The Holmgren laboratory studies pattern formation during animal development, focusing on the Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway and its role in patterning Drosophila segments and imaginal discs.  This pathway is conserved in vertebrates and used in the development of numerous tissues and organs.  Inappropriate activation of this pathway plays a central role in several important cancers.  Dr. Holmgren identified the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci) as the primary target of Hh signaling in Drosophila.  The laboratory is now trying to understand how the Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates different aspects of Ci function.  In more recent work, the Holmgren laboratory has established a collaboration with Dr. Matouschek to study the proteolytic processing of Ci by the proteasome.  Collaborative studies with Drs. Bushman and Iannaccone have been initiated on a coculture system using a human prostate tumor cell line and immortalized mouse urogenital sinus mesenchyme cells to study Hedgehog signaling in prostate cancer.  These studies address important issues in developmental biology and provide a basis for understanding the alterations in this pathway that give rise to cancer."Nimeiri	Halla S.	MD	hsn718	Pinkett	Heather W.	PhD	hwp673	Schnaper	H. William	MD	hws124	"<p>Dr. Schnaper's laboratory investigates the basic signal transduction mechanisms involved in signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. This multifunctional cytokine, which has been implicated in the regulation of cell division and differentiation, plays a key role in regulating cellular neoplastic transformation and metastatic behavior. Using as a model epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and type I collagen production by human kidney cells, the Schnaper lab has determined that a large number of signaling pathways interact with the classical TGF-beta target signaling molecules, known as Smads. These additional pathways include those mediated by the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C and phosphaditylinositol-3-kinase/Akt. Recently the group found that TGF-beta rapidly induces cytoskeletal rearrangement, leading to the determination that the Rho-family GTPase, RhoA, is rapidly activated by TGF-beta and mediates EMT. While most of the studies in the lab examine the role of signal transduction molecules in the cytoplasm, additional studies have examined the role of nuclear transcription factors and of events at the cell membrane involving adaptor molecules that facilitate the interaction of Smad proteins with the TGF-beta receptor. These studies suggest that cellular phenotype may be an important determinant of downstream effects of TGF-beta, and define a complex pattern of signaling interactions that regulate normal vs. abnormal cell function."Radhakrishnan	Ishwar	PhD	ira124	"<p>Research efforts in the Radhakrishnan lab are focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription regulation at multiple levels including sequence-specific DNA-binding, recruitment of coregulators, and assembly of multi-component nucleoprotein and chromatin-modifying complexes.

In recent years, Dr. Jameson's laboratory has focused on 3 main aspects of nuclear receptor function: 1) The role of the estrogen receptor in breast, ovarian, and uterine function under normal and pathological conditions such as cancer. In particular, his laboratory has used genetic models in mice to explore estrogen receptor signaling through nonclassical signaling pathways that do not require binding directly to estrogen response elements (EREs); 2) The role of steroidogenic factor 1(SF1) in adrenal and gonadal development. Dr. Jameson's laboratory also have identified human mutations in SF1 and have generated mouse models to examine SF1 function during development; 3) The role of the orphan nuclear receptor DAX1 in reproduction. In addition to these projects, Dr. Jameson's group is investigating gene therapy strategies and animal models useful for the treatment of pituitary tumors."Brickner	Jason	PhD	jbl357	"<p>Dr. Brickner's research is focused on how the localization of DNA within the nucleus affects transcription.  Brickner initially established that the localization of one gene, INO1, in the baker's yeast relocalizes from a random distribution to the nuclear periphery upon activation.  This relocalization is controlled by the same factors that regulate transcription and this recruitment to the nuclear membrane appears to be important for activation.  Subsequent work has identified a large number of genes regulated in this way.  The laboratory now seeks to understand how subnuclear environment is important in regulating transcription and how DNA localization is established and controlled.  These studies will change our understanding of transcriptional regulation and may highlight the importance of chromosomal context and folding in affecting the exposure of resident genes to specialized environments.  Transcriptional regulation is fundamentally involved in differentiation and oncogenesis.  A cellular understanding of this process will likely illuminate how normal regulation is disrupted during oncogenesis and how this process is coupled to the phenomenon of genomic instability."Schink	Julian C.

Dr. Licht's aim is to identify new therapeutic targets, examining the roles of these factors in cellular functions, as well as in transcriptional control of downstream targets with critical binding partners.  The first target, the WT1 gene, is mutated in Wilms' tumor and implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia.  Dr. Licht showed that WT1 can act as both a transcriptional repressor and an activator. Efforts are ongoing to identify Wt1 target genes relevant for tumor suppression.  The second target, Sprouty, likely represents a counter-regulatory signaling molecule that limits the effects of signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases.

Studies of a matrix metalloproteinase have shown its role in the ability of cells to degrade and cross the basement membrane. As metastsis of tumor cells involves cellular adhesion, migration and the ability to cross basement membranes, these studies in C. elegans provide insights into how these processes are normally controlled. An additional focus of Dr. Kramer's research is type XVIII collagen, its endostatin domain, and the molecular mechanisms through which they act.

Her laboratory focuses on how alterations in cell signaling affect breast cancer prognosis. Several new proteins are being studied that have shown potential to affect breast cancer onset and progression. While significant data exists to link the importance of a group of growth regulatory proteins known as the TGF_ superfamily to breast cancer development, the role of several members of this family, such as the growth factor activin, as well as that of the signal transducer  Smad 3, is not well understood.. Activin is a protein that acts on the cell surface to trigger specific cellular functions related to growth control. Smad 3 is a messenger protein that travels to the nucleus of the cell to enable specific growth regulatory actions. There is compelling preliminary data that links the actions of activin and Smad 3 to the regulation of normal cellular growth control in breast tissue. Additionally, Smad 3 has been shown to slow down the growth of breast cancer cells in the laboratory. Breast cancers that have intact activin and Smad 3 function are smaller and exhibit more favorable biologic phenotypes. The goal of the Jeruss laboratory is to further understand the mechanism by which Smad 3 acts to inhibit breast cancer growth and development and to identify the mechanism of inactivation of the Smad 3 protein. Additional work focuses on whether Smad 3 acts alone or in conjunction with additional key regulatory proteins to inhibit breast cancer cell growth. Lastly patient samples are being studied to determine if the presence or absence of Smad 3, along with two other key growth regulatory proteins, cyclins D1 and E, help to predict the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. These efforts will ultimately facilitate the further development of individualized care for patients, based on the unique biology of each breast cancer."Salsman	John Mark	PhD	jsv897	Varga	John	MD	jva128	"<p>Research in the Varga lab focuses on the pathomechanism of fibrosis and the role and mechanisms of action of growth factors such as TGF-_ in the process.  The work is aimed primarily at understanding the interplay between vascular and autoimmune events that underlie the development of tissue fibrosis in diverse conditions including scleroderma, radiation-induced fibrosis, diabetic glomerulosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, post-surgery adhesion, myelofibrosis and hypertrophic scarring. The lab utilizes a broad-based translational research approach in order to identify novel targets and design innovative treatment strategies for the control of fibrosis. Research in the Varga lab has established an essential role of TGF-_ and Smads in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, and more recently has broadened the work to examine the involvement of non-Smad signaling, including Egr-1, PDGF, and epigenetic modification by histone acetyltransferases. Small molecule inhibitors of these pathways are undergoing evaluation in vitro and in vivo. Particularly promising is the recent observation that c-Abl is implicated in fibrosis, and its selective inhibition with imatinib (Gleevec) offers a potential novel approach to fibrotis therapy. In collaborative studies, we are also focusing of the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and the role of genetic polymorphisms in the TGF-_ pathway as risk factors for the development of fibrosis.

Dr. Widom's research program is focused on understanding how gene regulatory proteins gain access to their target sites in chromatin, and how this is influenced and regulated by the three dimensional organization of the chromosome. A related component of his work addresses the structural and mechanical properties of the DNA itself. The goal of this work is to understand how differing DNA sequences control their own organization into the compacted chromatin fiber, or into complexes with gene regulatory proteins in which the DNA is sharply bent. These studies are intimately related to the problem of cancer, and to problems of human development and health more broadly. The development and health of all organisms requires that genes be expressed at proper levels, and only in the proper cell types, and only at proper times. Cancer arises when the expression of particular genes is aberrantly high or low. Gene expression may be aberrant either because of mutations or because of rearrangements at the DNA level, or because of epigenetic effects, in which the genome remains unchanged in sequence but its expression is altered nonetheless, often through mechanisms involving posttranslational modifications to the histone proteins, which are responsible for the initial stages of compaction of genomic DNA. Dr. Widom's work seeks to elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying gene regulation."Winter	Jane	MD	jwinter	"<p>Dr. Winter's research interest include biologic correlates of prognosis in the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, anti-idiotypic vaccines for the treatment of follicular lymphoma,  novel therapies including proteosome inhibition, novel antibodies and radioimmunotherapy in the treatment of the malignant lymphomas, and radioimmunotherapy in the setting of autologous stem cell transplantation. She and colleagues demonstrated that Rituximab selectively benefits bcl-6 negative patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with conventional CHOP chemotherapy (led to a Plenary manuscript in Blood, June 1, 2006). . She also showed that 1,55 cGY is the maximum tolerated dose of Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) in combination with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and autotransplant in patients with relapsed CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Her studies also showed no association between Chlamydia psittaci and ocular adnexal lymphoma in North American samples. Her observation that rituxan's benefit is restricted to bcl-6 negative cases has led to a collaboration exploring bcl-6 peptide inhibitors."Wu	Jane	"MD, PhD"	jwn341	"<p>Dr. Wu is interested in understanding how genetic mutations affect the expression and function of genes important for cell death and critical for the pathogenesis of neuronal cancer.  She focuses on two areas of research: the role of pre-mRNA splicing regulation and the molecular mechanisms modulating cell migration.  Pre-mRNA splicing is a crucial step for gene expression because the vast majority of human genes contain one or more introns that must be accurately removed to form the mature and functional messenger RNAs (mRNAs).  Alternative splicing is a major mechanism for regulating mammalian gene expression.  A number of apoptosis-regulatory genes, including Bcl-x, ced4/APAF1 and caspases, produce functionally antagonistic products by undergoing alternative splicing.  Dr. Wu's group demonstrated alternative splicing may be an important regulatory mechanism for apoptosis, which provides insights for designing new cancer therapies.  The other focus, chemotactic cell migration, is important for cancer progression.

Dr. Mayo's work on the actions of the brain peptide growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) led to the identification of a receptor for this peptide, and to demonstration that a mutation in this receptor is responsible for a form of dwarfism in the mutant mouse strain little. His current work focuses on understanding the regulation of GHRH receptor gene expression in the pituitary gland and on investigating the signaling pathways activated by the GHRH receptor in pituitary cells. Dr. Mayo is also interested in pituitary tumorigenesis that occurs in response to chronic elevations in GHRH. A second research area in the laboratory investigates hormones produced by the ovary that regulate reproductive function in mammals, focusing on the peptide hormones inhibin and activin. These hormones are required for normal reproductive function and have been implicated in the onset and progression of gonadal cancer.  Mouse genetic models are being used to understand the involvement of these ligands in normal reproductive function and in disorders leading the infertility or tumorigenesis."Green	Kathleen	PhD	kgreen	"<p>The goal of Dr. Green's research is to understand how intercellular adhesive structures in the skin and oral cavity are assembled and regulated during normal differentiation and in cancer, and to elucidate how these structures function at the intersection of mechanical and chemical signaling pathways. Current interests are focused on bi-directional signaling in which junctions serve as both targets and initiators of intracellular pathways that control cell motility, cell survival and differentiation of normal and tumor cells. Dr. Green has demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and inhibitors can promote desmosome assembly and increase the adhesive strength of tumor cells, and in vitro studies have uncovered a novel pathway whereby EGFR and the proteinase ADAM10 cooperate to regulate the internalization of desmosomal cadherin complexes.  Dr. Green is collaborating with clinical trials investigators to test whether desmosomal cadherins are useful prognostic markers for the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma."Scandrett	Karen	"MD, MPH"	kgs935	Iwasaki	Kouichi	PhD	kiw253	"<p>Dr. Iwasaki's laboratory studies functions of M-type transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the context of electrolyte homoeostasis using the model organism C. elegans. Some TRPM channels are implicated in cell growth, tumor formation, or cell death. For example, Melastatin (a short form of TRPM1, MLSN) expression in the cell lines and in melanocytic neoplasm's is inversely correlated with melanoma aggressiveness. Also, the MLSN RNA level appears to be a prognostic marker for metastasis in patients with localized malignant melanoma. Dr. Iwasaki's investigation has revealed that the TRPM channels, GTL-1 and GON-2, regulate electrolyte homeostasis, including Mg++ homeostasis in the C. elegans intestine. Interestingly, GTL-1 is continuously active while GON-2 is easily inactivated at higher Mg++ levels. This type of differential regulation of intestinal electrolyte absorption ensures a constant supply of electrolytes through GTL-1, while occasional bursts of GON-2 activity allow rapid return to normal electrolyte concentrations following physiological perturbations. Together the data suggest that TRP channels, not transporters, are mainly responsible for regulating homeostasis of Mg++ as well as other electrolytes, key processes necessary for cell growth."Dilley	Kimberley J	"MD, MPH"	kjd523	Yost	Kathleen	PhD	kjy291	"<p>Dr. Yost's research interests include health-related QOL in patients with cancer, clinical significance of patient-reported outcome measures, incorporating patient reported outcomes into clinical trials, race/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care access and delivery, measuring health literacy, and measuring patientsê perceived quality of cancer care.

Papillomaviruses are small DNA viruses that induce a variety of proliferative lesions in humans. Of the 100 types of human papillomaviruses that have been identified, a subset are associated at a high frequency with anogenital cancers and these are referred to as the high risk types Viral infection occurs into stratified epithelial cells and results in an altered pattern of differentiation from that seen in normal cells. The production of viral particles, genome amplification, capsid protein synthesis, and virion assembly is dependent upon differentiation and is restricted to suprabasal cells. Dr. Laiminsê has developed methods to synthesize HPV 31 virions from cloned transfected DNA templates following differentiation in organotypic cultures as well as suspension in semi-solid media. These methods allowed for a genetic analysis of HPV functions during the productive life cycle with a major focus on the activities of E1^E4, E5, E6 and E7. Recent studies from Dr. Laiminsê laboratory identified important roles for E7 interactions with HDACs in plasmid maintenance as well as E4 for differentiation-dependent activation of late viral functions. These are novel functions for proteins whose role has been well characterized in oncogenesis but not in the productive life cycle. Additional studies have used HPV 31 reporter viruses to show that HPV 31 uses the same entry mechanisms as those used by HPV 16."Peterson	LoAnn	MD	lcp123	"<p>Dr. LoAnn Peterson has a long standing interest in the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, especially the genetics and immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) .

He brings considerable expertise in the field of retrovirology with over 35 years of academic experience.  His is an important advisor and contributor to the Viral Oncogenesis Program and uses multidisciplinary molecular genetics and biochemical approaches to study replication of avian sarcoma and human retroviruses. Areas of particular interest are in basic mechanisms of viral DNA integration and virus assembly. Specific projects include studying 1) the mechanism of concerted integration of viral DNA into the host chromosome catalyzed by integrase (IN).  By using structural information from the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and HIV-1 INs and substituting key amino acids from one enzyme into structurally related positions of the other, the amino acid residues responsible for the specific recognition of the LTR ends were identified.  Three of these residues are among those that change in the development of drug resistance in response to anti HIV-1 IN drugs.  This information is very important to the treatment of AIDS and associated diseases such as Kaposi sarcomas.  2) The role of a Gag polyprotein late budding (L) assembly domain in virus particle release from cells is also studied.  The cellular protein that interacts with the L domain from RSV was identified and shown to be involved in ubiquitination of Gag required for budding.  The cellular protein that interacts with the HIV-1 L domain was also identified.  It is now known that the basic mechanism of budding Dr. Leis' lab co-discovered in the retroviruses is widely applicable to other envelope viruses including DNA tumor viruses."Hou	Lifang	"MD, PhD"	lho444	Gordon	Leo I.

The infectious agent of prion disease, PrPSc, is converted from a normal cellular host protein, PrPC, through an unknown mechanism. This protein conformation based transmission has now been used to explain several yeast epigenetic elements that are referred to as yeast prions, including [PSI+], [RNQ+], and [URE3]. Although the protein determinants of these yeast prions involve in diverse biological functions, they all contain a region that is highly rich in glutamine (Q) and apsargine (N). These Q/N rich domains are necessary and sufficient for yeast prion formation and propagation. There are about 100 yeast proteins contain such a Q/N rich domains and considered as yeast prion candidates. Dr. Liming Li's laboratory has focused on studying one such candidate, Snf5 protein. Snf5 is an important component of SWI/SNF remodeling complex, which is evolutionally conserved among yeast to human. The human SWI/SNF is known as an anti-tumor factor. Mutations in hSnf5/ini1, for example, can lead to development of several forms of cancers, such as breast cancer, brain tumor, and aggressive pediatric cancer. Dr Liming Li's laboratory has found that by replacing the prion domain of Sup35, the protein determinant of yeast prion [PSI+], with Snf5Q (1-297) at the SUP35 chromosomal site, Snf5 N region is shown to be able to epigenetically modify the function of Sup35 C-domain, exhibiting various [PSI+] phenotype: suppression on non-sense mutations.  Moreover, some yeast cells harboring the fusion gene also exhibit SWI/SNF deficient phenotype that can be epigenetically inherited. Her laboratory is currently investigating the role of such prion-like conformational switch in SWI/SNF mediated chromatin remodeling and its consequence in tumorigenesis."Kulik	Laura M.

The research is designed to increase our understanding of neural control of speech and swallowing in normal individuals from birth through senescence and increase our understanding of the effects of structural and neurologic damage on the control of these two functions. Through Dr. Logemann's program project, she has further defined normal speech and swallowing physiology, which has served as a basis for comparison of function in patients treated for head and neck cancer. This research has also defined a number of voluntary swallowing maneuvers, which have been utilized in the rehabilitation of head and neck cancer patients as well as in other patients with swallowing disorders. The nature of swallowing and speech disorders after specific treatments for particular site and stage of head and neck cancer and the factors that determine these treatment effects have been identified for some treatments. The role of extent of resection in laryngeal cancer patients and functional recovery also has been described. A functional status scale, the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer (PSS HNC), was validated for use in clinical trials and other protocols evaluating treatment effects on function. Procedures for temporal and biomechanical measurement of oropharyngeal swallow have been developed and applied to a number of patient types. These measurements have helped to define the abnormal physiologic components of swallow as well as the components of swallow, which need focus in rehabilitation. All of these contributions have been utilized by a number of other investigators and clinicians and have affected the care of head and neck cancer patients."Platanias	Leonidas	"MD, PhD"	lpl530	<p>Dr. Platanias joined the Robert H.

The tightly regulated expression of IL-4 by T cells and mast cells is a key factor for maintaining protective immunity. The expression of IL-4 by mast cells is particularly interesting in view of recent studies demonstrating that mast cells play a critical role in gut and lung immunity. Mast cells present in these sites are potent producers of IL-4 and other cytokines and thus can influence many processes including the generation of T helper responses, B cell growth, differentiation and antibody production as well as the recruitment of inflammatory cells.  The ultimate goal of the studies in Dr. Brown's laboratory is to better understand modulation of the innate immune response.  Such information can potentially be applied to immuno-therapeutic approaches to malignancy."Agulnik	Mark	MD	mag641	Hummel	Mary	PhD	mah834	"<p>Dr. Hummel's lab studies the molecular mechanisms by which cytomegalovirus (CMV) establishes latent infection, in which the DNA is present but no virus is produced, and the mechanisms by which the virus reactivates, starts actively replicating and induces disease in vivo. Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus which latently infects the majority of adults. Reactivation of latent virus occurs frequently, and in immunocompromised individuals, such as recipients of solid organ and bone marrow transplants, reactivation of CMV is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is frequently used in cancer patients. Complications arising from CMV infection and graft-versus-host disease have hindered the success of this treatment. HCMV pneumonia, which occurs in 10-20% of all allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, is associated with a mortality rate of 50%. Mice latently infected with murine CMV are used as a model for studying the role of allogeneic transplantation and inflammatory cytokines in inducing reactivation from latency in vivo.  Transgenic mice carrying a beta-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the HCMV IE promoter and mice deficient in various cellular genes are being used to identify cellular genes involved in reactivation of CMV during transplantation.  In addition, Dr. Hummel's lab is investigating the role of epigenetic factors in maintaining latent infection.  These factors are thought to be responsible for transcriptional silencing of the genome during latency, which allows the virus to escape immune surveillance by the host."Makoul	Gregory	PhD	makoul	"<p>Dr. Makoul is Professor and Director of the Center for Communication and Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine.

The virus encodes two proteins, large-T (LT) and small-t (ST), both of which are necessary for human cell transformation. These proteins alter behaviors of cells in culture, but do not immortalize them, so telomerase is also used to maintain stably transformed cells. The role of LT in transformation is well defined, because of its interaction with known tumor suppressor genes, pRB and p53. The role of ST is less well understood but its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is essential. A current approach is to use activated cellular functions in an effort to replace ST.  To date, ST has been at least partially replaced by a combination of the cellular functions, PKC-zeta and akt.  In human mesothelial cells, ST also plays a major role in allowing high levels of episomal viral genomes to be maintained. This is a very unusual virus-host interaction for SV40, but is likely to be important in the persistence of papovaviruses in the human population and in the potential promotion of some human cancers. The mechanisms through which episomal maintenance occurs in SV40 are being explored."Lamm	Marilyn	PhD	mll903	"<p>The overall research goal of the Lamm laboratory is to understand how cancer cells that have escaped the primary tumor are able to establish secondary tumors in specific metastatic sites such as bone. The central hypothesis is that invading cancer cells and tissue host stromal cells collaborate via reciprocal signaling pathways to promote metastatic cancer. Current research focuses on characterizing the role of the Sonic hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway in reciprocal interactions between epithelial-derived prostate cancer cells and host stromal cells in bone, the predominant site of metastatic spread of prostate carcinoma. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted glycopeptide that binds a transmembrane receptor protein, patched (Ptch), and activates an intracellular signaling cascade leading to transcriptional activation or respression of specific target genes by the Gli family of transcription factors (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3). The Shh-Gli pathway plays critical roles in patterning diverse structures during vertebrate development. Dysregulation of the pathway during postnatal life has been associated with several human cancers including digestive tract cancers, small-cell lung cancer, basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, sarcomas, and gliomas. Dr. Lamm has identified an important role for Shh-Gli signaling in prostate embryonic development and prostate tumorigenesis. Major goals of the current research are to establish a role for the Shh-Gli pathway in the development and growth of metastatic prostate carcinoma in bone and identify pathway-specific target genes for more effective therapeutic strategies in the fight against prostate cancer metastasis."Mondragon	Alfonso	PhD	mondrago	"<p>Dr. Mondragon's work is concerned with the structure and fuction of macromolecules.

Expression of one misfolded protein can disrupt the global balance of protein folding quality control, resulting in the loss-of-function of diverse metastable proteins with destabilizing temperature-sensitive mutations.  Similarly, metastable proteins are damaged as organism's age.  These proteins, even if innocuous under normal physiological conditions, significantly enhance the cellular folding dysfunction.  Thus, weak folding mutations throughout the genome can function as modifiers of cellular toxicity.  Up-regulation of molecular chaperone appears to be associated with oncogenesis and cellular transformation.  Drugs that affect the regulation of the heat shock response are therefore useful for both research into the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and, potentially, in clinical applications.  The Morimoto laboratory is searching for small molecule modifiers of chaperone function.  Since many cancer-associated mutations cause alteration of the native folded conformation of an affected molecule, the understanding of cellular responses to the appearance of misfolded proteins is also important."Ring	Melinda	MD	mrr427	Goel	Mita	MD	msg540	"<p>Dr. Sanghavi Goel specializes in health services research examining racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer care.

These investigations are likely to reveal patterns of value for patient stratification and prediction of clinical outcome. An important goal of this research is the investigation of the potential role that global hypomethylation may play in promoting genome instability in neuroblastomas. Another collaborative project under development in the Soaresê laboratory is investigating epigenomic changes underlying altered gene expression and genome instability in ependymomas, while assessing their value for prognosis and patient stratification. In a related project, these investigators are ascertaining the genotoxic effect of DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents in ependymomas, in particular with regard to the potential of these drugs to elicit activation of retrotransposable elements. Additional research in the Soaresê laboratory focuses in the analysis of an identified altered gene expression signature in metastatic dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. Also related to this project is the investigation of the contribution of the microenvironment to the gene expression profiles of Swarm rat chondrosarcomas grown subcutaneously, orthotopically (in the tibia) or in the lungs."Wolf	Michael	PhD	mwo292	"<p>Dr. Wolf is an Assistant Professor and a social/behavioral scientist and health services researcher with expertise in health literacy, learning, and cognition, health behavior, and health disparities. Over the past two years, he has co-authored nine published papers on colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, with two more in press. He has 19 peer-reviewed publications related to health literacy (out of a current total of 32), and was the primary author on the first population-based study to link inadequate health literacy to poorer overall health and higher prevalence of preventable diseases (Arch Int Med 165:1946-52, 2005). In addition, he recently presented findings at two national healthcare meetings describing the association between limited health literacy and mortality risk among Medicare enrollees (paper under review, N Engl J Med). His work on consumer medication information for prescribed drugs across all disease contexts, including cancer, has received national awareness (New York Times, October 26, 2005). Dr. Wolf is currently federally and privately funded to conduct both epidemiological and interventional studies addressing health-related literacy issues. He is beginning his third year under a K01 award through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address health literacy as a health disparities issue for disease self-management (including use of colorectal cancer screening services and prostate cancer decision making) via work in federally qualified health centers (1 K01 EH000067-01)."Zhang	Ming	PhD	mzh511	Laurie	Nikia	PhD	nal829	Contractor	Noshir	PhD	nco146	Hijiya	Nobuko	MD	nhi230	Krett	Nancy	PhD	nkrett	"<p>Dr. Krett's research effort is directed at understanding abnormalities in signal transduction pathways in malignant hematopoietic cells to identify novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these diseases.

Dr. Hansen will have a crucial role in the development and growth of the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center, increasing the clinical research program and transitioning the center into Northwestern Memorial Hospital's new Prentice Women's Hospital. Prior to her appointment at Northwestern, Dr. Hansen spent eight years at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in California, where she was the Associate Director of the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center. There she was involved in several clinical trials, including ones that focused on evaluating new techniques to reduce the extent of surgery, such as sentinel node biopsy and radiofrequency ablation of breast tumors. A less invasive but highly effective technique to search for cancer cells, the sentinel node biopsy is used to determine the stage of the patient's cancer by detecting if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes without using radical surgery. The technique has become the standard of care for breast cancer patients and was pioneered at the breast center at John Wayne. Dr. Hansen also supports a focus on breast conservation.

Dr. Yaseen showed that products of Nup98-HOX9 translocation acts as an aberrant transcription factor in AML, with a stronger and wider transcriptional activity than wild-type HOXA9. Leukemias associated with Nup98 gene rearrangements tend to be aggressive, with a poor response to therapy. The aim of Dr. Yaseen's research is to understand the mechanism of the transforming activity of Nup98-HOXA9, identifying genes that are directly regulated by Nup98-HOXA9 and assessing effects of Nup98-HOXA9 on proliferation, cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis.

The ligand Sonic        hedgehog, the receptors Patched and Smoothened, and the GLI family of        transcription factors represent a pathway critical to the normal development        of disparate organs due to their regulatory functions at the nexus of        mesenchymal differentiation. Sonic hedgehog is critical to development        and evidence suggests that GLI mediates regulation of differentiation        and proliferation through BMP4 in several organs including the lung, prostate        and the GI tract. Dr. Iannaccone's experiments will provide data of great        significance to cancer because GLI is a known oncogene associated with        rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, and medulloblastoma. In addition, Basal        cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer in man and mutations in        Patched or overexpression of GLI are both strongly associated with BCC.        Dr. Iannaccone's lab is working to establish the regulation of the GLI        genes at a transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and functional (protein-protein        interactions) level. The long-term goals of his work will be to determine        pathways of development involving GLI genes and their interactions with        environmental exposures, in order to establish mechanisms of interactions        with downstream targets. Dr. Iannaccone has established the genomic organization        of the human gene, the role of a VP16 like domain in transactivation by        GLI, and has isolated the human promoter.

He has collaborates with Dr. Lamb and along with Dr. Lamb provides considerable expertise to the members of the Viral Oncogenesis Program whose work is focused on the entry of viruses associated with human cancers.  Pinto's work determined the acidifying factor of influenza B virus and identified the molecular mechanism for gating of the influenza A and B virus acidifying factors. These factors are the A/M2 protein of influenza A virus and the BM2 protein of influenza B virus. Both are homotetrameric integral membrane proteins with a single extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain that contains a pore through protons must flow and a cytoplasmic tail domain. Pinto's group determined that the BM2 protein, previously thought to be a cytoplasmic protein, is capable of acidifying the virus, a step that is a necessary prerequisite for viral uncoating. The group also showed that one of the residues in the transmsmbrane domain, a tryptophan near the inner membrane leaflet, lines the pore of the oligomer and also acts as a •gateê that opens and shuts to permit protons to flow or stop protons from flowing through the pore. Pinto's laboratory partipates in the Center for Functional Genomics and has identified three mutations that affect the visual system.

Sdh is a tumor suppressor gene comprised of four subunits (A,B,C and D) that form Complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This complex also functions as a component of the Krebs cycle. Genetic disruptions of subunits B, C and D have been linked to the development of pheochromocytoma or paragangliomas, whereas defects in SdhA result in the metabolic deficiency of Leigh's syndrome. His laboratory has previously shown that increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the mitochondria triggers Hypoxia-Inducible Factor activation in hypoxia. HIF activation has been linked to tumor angiogenesis, tumor progression and metastasis. Disruption of SdhB, C or D causes an increase in ROS production at SdhA, which could trigger HIF activation and contribute to mitochondrial and genomic instability through oxidative stress. The laboratory is testing the hypothesis that the tumor phenotype associated with genetic defects in SdhB, C or D is a consequence of increased ROS production and HIF activation, whereas defects in SdhA prevent ROS formation and HIF activation while they inhibit ATP formation."Gao	Qingshen	MD	qga571	"<p>The Gao laboratory focuses on dissecting the BRCA2 tumor suppressor pathway using two approaches: first, to determine the proteome of the BRCA2 pathway; second, to identify the BRCA2 regulated genes at transcriptional level using microarray and Chip-Chip assays.

Overall, his laboratory is interested in defining the mechanism of viral entry into target cells.  Although, the viruses his laboratory focuses have no role in viral induced cancers, his work provides an important basis for work in the Viral Oncogenesis Program which is focused on the entry of viruses associated with human cancer.  Influenza virus and the paramyxoviruses PIV5 (formerly known as SV5) and hPIV3 were selected for study by Dr. Lamb not only because of their importance as the causative agents of major diseases but also because they provide excellent models for examining a variety of properties of integral membrane proteins.  As these proteins are the major antigenic determinants of the viruses, knowledge about their structure will enhance the understanding of how to develop new vaccines.  In addition, some of the biochemical activities of the viruses are specialized to the virus, making them attractive as points of intervention in the virus life cycle to which rationally designed therapeutic agents can be developed. Several different projects are under study: (1) The mechanism by which viruses enter cells by virus-mediated membrane fusion and determination of the atomic structure of the viral fusion (F) protein;  (2) The protein-protein interactions necessary for virus assembly; (3) The structure and function of the minimalistic influenza virus-encoded ion channels, M2, and BM2; (4) Endocytosis and degradations signals in viral glycoproteins, (5) The interaction of the multifunctional V protein of paramyxoviruses with cellular proteins to control the cell cycle and the interferon response to SV5 infection; (6) Using reverse genetics to understand viral pathogenesis.  In 2005/6 in collaboration with Dr. Theodore Jardetzky, Dr. Lamb obtained the atomic structure of the paramyxovirus F protein both in its metastable pre-fusion conformation and in its post-fusion conformation . These two structures reveal the largest protein rearrangement observed in biology to date and provide a fascinating insight into the mechanism of virus-mediated membrane fusion.  Further, several technical developments in protein expression that were made in our structural studies may be directly applicable to studies on other viral glycoproteins including those of EBV and all retroviruses."Bergan	Raymond	MD	rbe510	"<p>Dr. Bergan is a physician/scientist and is the Cancer Center's Director of Experimental Therapeutics.

When a specific enzyme target is identified, studies directed at correlating enzyme inhibition with antitumor activity are carried out. Further mechanistic and animal studies are carried out in collaboration with colleagues at the medical school. One important marine natural product is sansalvamide A, a cyclic depsipentapeptide produced by a marine fungus of the genus Fusarium. This natural product is a highly lipophilic compound that was found to have significant cancer cell cytotoxicity with a mean IC50 value of 27.4 µg/mL against the National Cancer Institute's 60 cell-line panel. It was shown to inhibit topoisomerase I in poxvirus. The Silverman group has developed new solid-phase synthetic approaches to synthesize a library of analogs containing nonnatural amino acids. Several of these compounds exhibit greater activity against each of the tumor cell lines than the natural product. Three of the analogs are much more potent against pancreatic cancer, but no correlation was found between inhibition of topoisomerase I and their antitumor activity in pancreatic cancer. Another target in the Silverman group is histone deacetylase. Suberoylanilide hydroxamate (SAHA), a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor shown to bind tightly to the active site zinc ion, is currently in clinical trials. The Silverman group has synthesized SAHA analogs with side chains containing groups other than hydroxamic acid because of the metabolic instability of the hydroxamate group. Two alternative zinc-binding side chains have been identified, and the corresponding SAHA analogs are slightly more potent than SAHA against histone deacetylase. This side chain is being incorporated into a marine natural product cyclic tetrapeptide that exhibited cytotoxicity as low as 0.6 µg/mL with overall cytotoxicity in the National Cancer Institute panel at 0.75 µM."Carthew	Richard	PhD	rca623	"<p>The Carthew laboratory investigates how molecular signals are decoded into information that controls cell differentiation, growth, and morphogenesis during development.  One project concerns how the family of growth factor signaling molecules control cell differentiation.  These signals are received in cells by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and are decoded into choices about cell differentiation.  Only two growth factor signals are used to trigger differentiation of all cell-types in the eye, and they use a common signal transduction pathway called the RAS pathway.  The RAS pathway also regulates cell proliferation in the eye, and mutations in the RAS pathway in humans lead to many different types of cancer.  Another area of interest is in microRNAs.  This remarkable class of RNAs constitutes 1% of the genes in the human genome, and they repress the expression of protein-coding genes by attenuating protein synthesis.  From 4 - 20% of protein-coding genes might be directly controlled by microRNAs.  The Carthew laboratory investigates how microRNAs specifically inhibit their target genes and the biological consequences of this regulation.  For example, the laboratory discovered that microRNAs stimulate adult stem cells to divide continuously in a quiescent niche.  Misregulation of microRNAs appears to underlie complex disease phenomena such as cancer susceptibility and progression.  Indeed, microRNAs have been shown to act as oncogenes."Seftor	Richard	PhD	res992	"<p>A major focus of Dr. Seftor's research is the examination of tumor cell/extracellular matrix interactions that contribute to the invasive and/or metastatic processes associated with cancer progression. Recently, microarray gene chip analyses of highly compared to poorly aggressive melanoma cells identified an increase in the expression of certain genes with the aggressive, vasculogenic mimicry phenotype demonstrated by aggressive melanoma cells. Vasculogenic mimicry describes a process where aggressive tumor cells in three-dimensional matrices mimic embryonic vasculogenesis by forming extracellular matrix-rich, patterned tubular networks. Microarray analyses revealed a significant increase in the expression of laminin-5 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aggressive compared to poorly aggressive melanoma cells and these components were found to co-localize with developing patterned networks.  Poorly aggressive melanoma cells seeded on a three-dimensional matrix pre-conditioned by the aggressive cells formed tubular networks along the laminin-5 gamma 2 chain-enriched tracks deposited into the matrix by the aggressive cells.  Furthermore, generation of laminin-rich, patterned networks by aggressive melanoma tumor cells in three-dimensional culture appears to recapitulate the networks observed in aggressive melanoma patientsê tissue sections. These results suggest that culturing aggressive tumor cells in three-dimensional matrices may serve as a model to help identify specific molecular targets that could function as templates for the coordinated migration of aggressive tumor cells and the proteolytic remodeling of their extracellular microenvironment, and may lead to profound implications for the development of novel therapies directed at the extracellular matrix to alter tumor progression."Goldman	Robert	PhD	rgoldman	"<p>The intermediate filament (IF) network is utilized by cells to establish intracellular connections from the cell surface to the nucleus.

Dr. Goldman focuses on the structure and function of IF networks in normal and neoplastic fibroblasts and epithelial cells.  This large family of proteins establishes networks throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus.  Recently, Dr. Goldman demonstrated that nuclear IFs (lamins) form a nucleoplasmic network that is involved in regulation of DNA replication.  Because the IF system forms a dynamic network linking the nuclear and cell surfaces, additional studies are underway to examine the contribution of IFs to diverse cellular processes such as maintenance of cell shape, organelle movements, nuclear positioning, signal transduction and chromatin organization."Miller	Richard	PhD	rjm821	"<p>Dr. Richard Miller's research is concerned with how receptor activation regulates different types of neural cell functions. This includes the regulation of neuronal survival, development and carcinogenesis.  In particular he is interested in the functions and mechanisms of action of G protein coupled receptors, ion channels and intracellular calcium signaling.  Recent work has focused on the functions of chemokines and their receptors in the nervous system.  His group showed that neural stem cells express a number of chemokine receptors, including the CXCR4 receptor, which acts as a receptor for HIV-1, and that interference with chemokine signaling has several effects on the nervous system.  They demonstrated that glioma cells express different types of chemokine receptors and that chemokines can have effects on glial tumor proliferation and infiltration."Lewandowski	Robert	MD	rle202	Longnecker	Richard	PhD	rlong	"<p>Disease syndromes in humans caused by EBV reflect the cell types that EBV infects, being primarily of lymphoid or epithelial origin. The most notable lymphoid disease, infectious mononucleosis, is a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disease that occurs in normal adolescents upon primary infection. Children are normally able to resolve primary EBV infection with few or no symptoms. By the age of 25 most individuals are EBV seropositive. EBV is associated with a variety of hematopoietic cancers such as African Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia. EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired cellular immune deficiencies. EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease occurs in 1 percent to 10 percent of transplant recipients and in AIDS patients. The two notable epithelial diseases associated with EBV infection are nasopharyngeal cancer, a malignancy endemic to southern China, and oral hairy leukoplakia, an epithelial hyperplasia of the lingual squamous epithelium in AIDS patients. B lymphocytes infected in vivo or in vitro by EBV become latently infected by the virus and are driven to proliferate indefinitely. These transformed, latently infected B lymphocytes contain EBV episomes that express eight virus-encoded proteins. Six are nuclear proteins (EBNAs) and two are the integral membrane proteins LMP1 and LMP2. These eight proteins mediate latent virus infection or B lymphocyte proliferation and are being studied in Dr. Longnecker's laboratory. Dr. Longnecker is most interested in LMP1 and LMP2, which besides EBNA1 (required for episome maintenance) are the two transformation-associated proteins most consistently detected in EBV-related malignancies. In addition, the LMP2 message is the only message detected in PCR analysis of B lymphocytes from individuals harboring latent EBV infections. Dr. Longnecker's current studies of LMP2 have shown that it down regulates LMP1 activation of B lymphocytes and prevents normal signal transduction through cell surface receptors. In addition, he has shown that LMP2 prevents the switch from latent infection to lytic infection following activation of the B-cell receptor in B lymphocytes latently infected with EBV. Finally, Dr. Longnecker has shown using in vivo models of EBV latent infection that LMP2 provides an inappropriate survival signal to primary B lymphocytes. These LMP2 functions may be important for persistence of EBV in the human host. Dr. Longnecker is identifying LMP2-associated proteins. LMP2 associates with LMP1, Src family tyrosine kinases, the Syk tyrosine kinase, Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases, and at least four unidentified cell proteins, several of which are tyrosine phosphorylated. Finally, he is investigating the role of LMP2 in primary EBV infections and latency in animal models of EBV pathogenesis. Recently. Dr. Longnecker's laboratory has expanded their studies into the function of lytic cycle genes that are important in the virus life cycle. Specifically viral proteins important for virus binding, entry and maturation from susceptible cells are being studies. Dr. Longnecker is also performing a variety of screens to identify cellular factors important for virus binding, entry and maturation from susceptible cells. Ultimately, studies in Dr. Longnecker's laboratory may provide insight for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of EBV-related malignancies, a better understanding of the viral life cycle in the human host, and a general understanding of lymphocyte signal transduction."Pope	Richard	MD	rmp158	"Dr. Richard Pope studies inflammatory cytokines. Several of these molecules help regulate tumor growth and angiogenesis. Of these cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may be the most important because it is capable of inducing cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. Dr. Pope is studying the effects of TNF using a gene therapy approach. A second area of interest relates to apoptosis or programmed cell death. He recently identified the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, Flice Like Inhibitory Protein (Flip), during monocyte differentiation. He has demonstrated that Flip is responsible for protecting macrophages from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Additionally he has shown that inhibition of NF-kB results in marcrophage apoptosis. This is mediated by damage to the mitochondria, which results in cytochrome c release, activation of caspase 9 and cell death by apoptosis. Cell death is protected in macrophages by the expression of Bcl-xL and Akt-1. Dr. Pope is currently examining the hypotheses: (1) that the regulated expression of Flip controls Fas-mediated apoptosis in macrophages; (2) that the constitutive activation of NF-kB protects macrophages from apoptosis, which is initiated by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and that this NF-kB activation is mediated by Akt-1 and (3) that Flip is expressed in macrophages and that inhibition of Flip or NF-kB activation will lead to apoptosis. Additional studies have demonstrated that inhibition of Bcl-2 by a replication defective adenoviral vector that reduced Bcl-2 resulted in apoptosis also mediated by cytochrome c release, caspase 9 activation and cell death by apoptosis."Keswani	Rajesh	MD	rnk801	Roy	Hemant	MD	roy056	"<p>Dr. Roy's efforts are focused on understanding the mechanisms through which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prevent colon cancer. His laboratory is particularly interested in regulation of beta-catenin signaling by NSAIDS. In Dr. Roy's labs, researchers are exploring some determinants of subcellular localization of beta-catenin. With regards to early detection, in collaboration with Dr. Vadim Backman, Dr. Roy is examining whether light-scattering spectroscopy (LSS) may be a useful tool for colorectal cancer screening. His data in the azoxymethane-treated rat model of experimental colon cancer suggests that LSS detects abnormalities related to the ""field effect"" of carcinogenesis far earlier than conventional genetic or morphological biomarkers. Presently, Dr. Roy is investigating whether LSS may be of value as an intermediate biomarker for chemoprevention studies."Salem	Riad	MD	rsa645	Scarpulla	Richard	PhD	rsc248	"<p>Because of the limited coding capacity of mtDNA the nuclear genome must provide the majority of the constituents needed for mitochondrial functions, including the maintenance and expression of mtDNA. This arrangement necessitates the interplay of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic systems in meeting cellular energy demands. Previous studies have led to the discovery, purification and molecular cloning of nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs) 1 and 2. These transcriptional activators act on the majority of nuclear genes that are required for mitochondrial respiratory function. A second class of nuclear regulator is the PGC-1 family of coactivators that includes PGC-1_, PRC and PGC1_. These molecules do not bind DNA but rather work through their interactions with multiple transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Dr. Scarpulla has found an important feature of these coactivators is that their expression is responsive to physiological signals mediating adaptive thermogenesis, cell proliferation and gluconeogenesis. His recent focus has been on PRC, a NRF-1 coactivator that is rapidly up-regulated in proliferating cells and down-regulated upon exit from the cell cycle. PRC is a unique example of a growth-regulated coactivator, which acts predominantly in the G0 to G1 transition from quiescence to proliferative growth. Further characterization of PRC should provide insight into the genetic program regulating cell proliferation."Thomson	Regan J	PhD	rtj232	Wali	Ramesh	PhD	rwali@enh.org	"<p>Dr. Wali's primary research interest is in the area of colon cancer chemoprevention.

In collaboration with Hemant Roy, MD, and Vadim Backman, PhD, Dr. Wali is also testing technology that can help in the early detection of cancer as well as rapid validation of the efficacy of any particular chemopreventive strategy."Weitzman	Sigmund	MD	saweitz	"<p>Dr Weitzman is a medical oncologist.  His recent studies on the interaction of breast epithelial cells with the extracellular matrix have led to new insights concerning the production of the extracellular matrix protein laminin-5 (the major extracellular matrix protein of breast epithelium). In addition, the development of a gene therapy vector transcriptionally targeted to specifically kill breast cancer cells has been successfully developed in collaboration with Dr. Bayar Thimmapaya (Viral Oncogenesis).  Dr. Weitzman also continues his longstanding interest in the toxic effects of free radicals, including studies in breast cancer of an enzyme that repairs DNA damage due to products of lipid peroxidation."Basti	Surendra	MD	sba689	Bulun	Serdar	MD	sbu768	"<p>Dr. Bulun's research focuses on estrogen and progesterone formation and action in breast and gynecologic cancers.  A team of investigators in his lab works on understanding the epithelial _stromal interactions and overexpression of the gene encoding the aromatase enzyme in breast cancer tissue.  Since aromatase inhibitors treat breast tumors primarily via suppressing intratumoral estrogen biosynthesis, these efforts are important for discovering new targets of treatment.  They characterized critical molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in the biosynthesis of estrogen by the aromatase enzyme in breast cancer.  In addition to identifying tissue-specific inhibitors of aromatase, which target signaling pathways in breast tumor cells, they recently demonstrated that the breast tumor suppressor BRCA-1 directly binds to the aromatase promoter and inhibits it in breast tissue.  This suggests that women with BRCA-1 deficiency are predisposed to breast cancer at least in part due to aromatase overexpression in breast tissue.  Moreover, Dr. Bulun's team designed specific drug regimens and eventually ran pioneering phase II trials for the treatment of premenopausal women with aromatase inhibitors.  In addition, his lab has identified novel mechanisms of nuclear action of the estrogen receptor-alpha in breast cancer.  The common link between these projects is signal transduction, particularly related to cell surface receptors, second messengers, transcriptional regulation and steroid receptor action."Chaudhury	Sonali	MD	sch896	Corey	Seth	"MD, MPH"	scl669	Rice	Sarah	PhD	ser710	"<p>The Rice laboratory studies the functions of molecular motors, with a specific emphasis on motor tail domains.

Many of these changes are identifiable at the light microscopic level, including increases in nuclear size, deformities in nuclear shape, and changes in the internal organization of the nucleus. Dr. Huang's laboratory has been focused on the understanding of a unique subnuclear structure, the perinucleolar compartment (PNC), which is associated with the nucleolus and is present primarily in cancer cells and transformed cell lines. PNC prevalence (percentage of cells that contain at least one PNC) increases in parallel with the diseases progression in breast cancer and reaches nearly 100% in distant metastasis. Her findings suggest that PNCs are involved in transcription and RNA metabolism, both of which are significantly altered during the development of malignancy. Thus, the presence of PNCs represents changes in cell and molecular activities in transformed cells and could be a good indicator for the progression of malignancy. Her goals are 1) to understand the function of PNC in transformed cells, and 2) to evaluate the possibility of using PNC prevalence as a useful tumor marker, both for prognosis and anti-cancer drug development. Over the past a few years, she has examined PNC prevalence in a spectrum of normal and cancerous breast tissues in collaboration with a team of pathologists at the Robert H. Lurie Cancer Center, including Drs. Ann Thor (now Oklahoma Health Center), Ritu Nayar, and Elizabeth Wiley, as well as Dr. Borko Jovanovic of the Public Health Department. Preliminary results from over 230 samples showed remarkable differences in the PNC prevalence among normal, benign epithelium hyperplasia, in situ carcinomas, invasive ductal carcinomas with no lymph node involvement, and invasive ductal carcinomas those became metastatic to either lymph node or distant sites. PNC prevalence increases with the clinical progression of the disease. More interestingly, statistical analyses in follow-up case-matched studies showed that samples derived from patients who had recurrence demonstrate a significantly higher PNC prevalence as compared to those from patients who had similar primary diagnosis and did not develop recurrence, suggesting that PNC prevalence impart useful prognostic information. She is currently evaluating the prognostic value of PNCs not only in breast tissues, but also in other tissue types. Dr. Huang is also focusing on the nucleolus, the center for ribosome biogenesis, because it also is the most prominent nuclear marker for cancer diagnosis. Both ribosome biogenesis and nuclear structure are altered significantly to meet the needs of malignant cells.  She has set up a system where we could analyze the remodeling of rDNA chromatin and the assembly of the pol I transcription machinery. She is interested in using live cell systems to analyze the essential cis and trans elements that are important in regulating specific ribosome synthesis machinery. These basic studies are crucial for the understanding of malignant transformation and for devising appropriate therapeutic strategies."Stupp	Samuel	PhD	sis997	"<p>The Stupp group has been researching peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofiber systems as novel drug delivery devices for cancer therapy.  While much research in the literature has examined spherically symmetric therapeutic vehicles, such as micelles and liposomes, less has been explored in the way of high aspect ratio structures like the PA nanofiber, which can resemble the extracellular matrix naturally present in vivo.  PA nanofibers retain the advantage of being biodegradable self-assembling systems in which multifunctionality can be afforded by simply co-assembing monomers with different bioactive peptide head groups for targeting or signaling.  Furthermore, the self-assembly by hydrophobic collapse allows for encapsulation of various drugs to enable combination therapies.  Specifically, our work focuses on applying PA systems to the treatment of breast cancers overexpressing the ErbB-2 receptor, which can indicate a poorer prognosis for the patient.  Currently, PAs bearing anti-ErbB-2 epitopes for the encapsulation and targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs are being studied in vitro.  These systems will ultimately be tested in vivo through collaborations with Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute."Komanduri	Srinadh	"MD, MS"	ska243	Khan	Seema	"MD, SM"	skh770	"<p>Dr. Khan is a co-leader of the Breast Program, with an emphasis on clinical and breast cancer prevention research. Her research seeks to identify biomarkers of risk for breast cancer, and surrogate endpoints for breast cancer prevention, in small epithelial cell samples derived from women at high risk for breast cancer. Her group has looked at samples obtained in a variety of ways (ductal lavage, random fine needle aspiration, ductoscopy washings, and nipple aspiration fluid) in order to assess the optimal method of cell sampling and of processing the cellular material for these studies. The important issue of reproducibility of biomarker measurement has been addressed using ductal lavage samples obtained from high risk women by repeat lavage of fluid-yielding nipple ducts. Biomarker changes in epithelial cells obtained from ductal lavage samples in women on tamoxifen are being compared to an observation group who declined tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer risk-reduction. The supernatant fluid from these samples is being studied for levels of steroid hormones (in collaboration with Dr. Robert Chatterton) and for novel protein markers using SELDI-TOF technology (in collaboration with Dr. Jinong Li at John Hopkins University). DNA methylation profiles in epithelial cells from tamoxifen users and non-users are being studied in collaboration with Dr. Sara Sukumar, also at John Hopkins. A second focus of the Khan laboratory is the understanding of sulfatase (STS) gene regulation in breast epithelium, with the goal of developing novel methods of sulfatase inhibition as an endocrine strategy for breast cancer treatment and prevention. Experiments investigating the molecular mechanism of STS gene regulation have shown, as reported by others, that STS gene expression is induced by estradiol (E2), that the increase is mediated through the estrogen receptor (ER), and that this up-regulation is abolished by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. In addition, these experiments have identified novel isoforms of the STS gene, which may lead to the development of methods of tissue-specific inhibition of STS for breast cancer therapy and prevention.  Dr. Khan is protocol-PI for a Phase IIB study of soy supplementation in healthy women at increased risk for breast cancer, wherein breast cancer biomarkers are being assessed pre- and post-supplementation using random fine needle aspiration. In addition, she has received funding from the Early Detection Research Network of the NCI to investigate the utility of mammary endoscopy as a diagnostic procedure in women with spontaneous nipple discharge. She is also site-PI for clinical protocols of the NSABP (P-2) and ACOSOG."Kundu	Shilajit	MD	sku680	Ma	Shuo	"MD, PhD"	sma160	Rao	M.

Dr. Seth chose to use an adenoviral dl01/07 mutant because it can replicate in all cancer cells regardless of their genetic defects. To induce systemic effects, Dr. Seth targeted the TGF_ pathway because high levels of TGF_-1 have been shown to have tumor growth promoting activities by enhancing angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, and by inhibiting immune functions. An oncolytic adenovirus expressing soluble TGF_RIIFc (Ad.sT_RFc) was constructed by homologous recombination method. Infection of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with Ad.sT_RFc produced sTGF_RIIFc that was released into the media. The conditioned media containing sTGF_RIIFc could bind with TGF_-1 and inhibited TGF_-dependent transcription in the target cells. Infection of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and 76NE human breast cancer cells with Ad.sT_RFc resulted in high levels of viral replication that were comparable to that of a wild type dl309 virus. Direct injection of Ad.sT_RFc into MDA-MB-231 human breast xenograft tumors grown in nude mice resulted in the significant inhibition of tumor growth causing tumor regressions in more than 85% of the animals. These results indicate that it is possible to construct an oncolytic adenovirus expressing sTGF_RIIFc in which both the viral replication and the transgene expression remain intact, and the recombinant adenovirus is oncolytic in a human tumor xenograft model. Currently, Dr. Seth is developing oncolytic adenoviruses viruses in which the viral replication will be controlled by the breast tumor specific promoters, and will target the tumor cells using the tumor hoping peptides. These novel oncolytic adenoviruses will be examined in the breast tumor xenografts as well as in the syngeneic mice tumor models."Singhal	Seema	MD	ssi694	"<p>Dr. Singhal's research interests include the role of new drugs in myeloma such as histone deacetylase inhibitors; Perifostine, an AKT inhibitor; and newer combinations of chemotherapeutic agents such as Bortezomib, Lenalinamide and Thalidomide.

Ikaros is a hematopoietic-specific zinc finger DNA-binding protein that plays an important role in lymphocyte development. Disruption of the gene encoding Ikaros results in T cell transformation in vitro and leukemia with 100% penetrance in  Ikaros null mice.  These results suggest Ikaros functions as a T-cell tumor suppressor gene. Consistent with this, deregulation of Ikaros expression has been observed in some forms of human leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Dr. Winandy's laboratory has shown that introduction of Ikaros into an established mouse Ikaros null T cell leukemia line leads to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Further work in Dr. Winandy's laboratory demonstrated that this G0/G1 arrest is associated with up-regulation of the cell cycle dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, expression of T cell differentiation markers and increase in histone H3 acetylation status. The ultimate goal of the studies in Dr. Winandy's laboratory is to understand the mechanism by which Ikaros mutations lead to T cell leukemia in mice and thereby identify rationale targets for therapeutic approaches to human T-cell malignancies."Yount	Susan	PhD	syo450	"<p>Dr. Yount's research interests include psychosocial aspects of cancer and chronic illness and clinical applications of health-related QOL and symptom assessment.

The main goal of the research is to develop a combinatorial approach by integrating three dimensional tissue engineering and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to dynamically monitor the signaling events induced by metastatic tumors in endothelial cells to cause vascular leakage. In order to decipher how the endothelial retraction is mediated by the tumor cells in situ, and to simulate the 3D environment wherein breast cancer and endothelial cells interact, the Chew lab engineers endothelial vasculature in a 3D co-culture matrix system and characterizes, using time-lapse spinning disc confocal microscopy and a plethora of FRET-based sensors, the signaling events of Rho, Rac, and myosin light chain kinase in situ during active tumor invasion. The successful completion of this project will enhance our understanding of how breast cancer transiently seizes control of the contractile system to breach the endothelial barrier during invasion, and pinpoint potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Using the 3D matrix assay, translational experiments are focused  to determine if (i) statins, (ii) Rho kinase inhibitor, and (iii) MLCK inhibitor can attenuate VEGF-induced endothelial hyperpermeability, and reduce breast cancer transendothelial migration. Using their library of FRET-based biosensors, Dr. Chew and co-workers will dynamically test if these drugs exert their anti-metastatic effects by (a) attenuating the VEGF-induced activities of Rho family of GTPases, and (b) by down-regulating myosin activity. These findings may identify the antimetastatic effects of obliterating these signaling components along the vascular permeability pathway, thus granting novel rationale to use these inhibitors as anti-cancer agents."Hope	Thomas	PhD	tjh769	"<p>Dr. Hope's group is focusing on the study of the cell biology of HIV.  HIV can influence cancer both by weakening the immune system and direct involvement in cell transformation.  Patients with AIDS are more susceptible to cancers including some with a direct viral etiology.  Overall, the work in Dr. Hope's laboratory is directed at understanding basic HIV replication that may result in new therapies directed at HIV replication that could reduce the incidence of HIV-associated cancers.  Work in Dr. Hope's laboratory determined the mechanism of the stimulation of HIV infectivity by dendritic cells through the process of trans-infection.  This analysis defined the infectious synapse, which is formed at the site of contact between the dendritic cells and target cells and has some similarities with the infectious synapse.  The concentration of HIV from the dendritic cells with receptors on the target cells at the site of contact facilitates infection.  This appears to be a common mechanism for the stimulation of infectivity by dendritic cells by a number of viral and bacterial pathogens.  Recent studies published in PNAS provided important insights into the function of the endogenous antiretroviral factor TRIM5alpha.  These studies revealed that TRIM5alpha restricts HIV infection in two steps, one that involved proteasome function.  Subsequent studies demonstrate that the same is true of the restriction of infection of the potentially oncogenic mouse retroviruses by human TRIM5alpha.  Other studies focus on defining the dynamic in teractions of HIV with its receptor and coreceptor on the cell surface.  Overall, Dr. Hope's studies provide important insights into the retroviral lifecycle and the dynamic interplay between the virus and cells.  These results defined with HIV can also be applied to the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and other oncogenic viruses."McGarry	Thomas	"MD, PhD"	tjm007	"<p>Dr. McGarry is interested in how cell division is controlled throughout development and how it is coupled to cell differentiation.  Cancer cells are characterized by both poorly controlled proliferation and a loss of the differentiated phenotype.  Dr. McGarry studies a number of well-described changes in the pattern of cell division that occur during the early development of the frog Xenopus laevis. Mature oocytes are arrested in prophase of the first meiotic division and can remain in that condition for a prolonged period of time (up to 50 years in humans). In response to a hormonal signal, they begin meiosis and then arrest again in metaphase of the second meiotic division. The arrest is broken at fertilization, and the egg undergoes a series of rapid (~30 min/division) synchronous cell cycles to produce a ball of cells called a blastula. After 12 divisions the cell cycle slows considerably and becomes asynchronous as the cells begin to express differentiated markers. The major goal of his research is to identify the proteins and the signaling systems that regulate these transitions."Meade	Thomas	PhD	tjm604	"<p>Dr. Meade is the Eileen M.

Her team described the activin-dependent signal transduction pathway leading to growth restriction in breast and ovarian cancer cells. The group has developed an animal model of ovarian cancer. The elucidation of the ligand structure and correlation with function in a variety of cancer models is a central focus of the Woodruff lab. A second area of research emphasis in the Woodruff Laboratory is gamete preservation and follicle development for female survivors of cancer. Female survivors of cancer are often left with few viable eggs and no reliable egg bank exists. In collaboration with Lonnie Shea in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, the Woodruff laboratory developed strategies for follicle growth in vitro. Based on this technology, the RHLCCC and the Center for Reproductive Science have established the Center for Families after Cancer, a comprehensive center bringing clinical practices, basic science, bioethics and education together into one entity. Men and women facing life-preserving but fertility-threatening chemo- or radiation therapy, now have options for gamete preservation. Finally, the Woodruff laboratory has invested effort in the development of assays that can detect ovarian cancer at earlier and more treatable stages.

These studies are in the early stages of development and exemplify the kind of trans-disciplinary research effort that occurs at Northwestern University."Ouchi	Toru	PhD	tou767	"<p>Dr. Ouchi is a molecular biologist and has been working on the mechanism of human cancer development. In particular, Dr. Ouchi's primary research of interests includes breast cancer caused by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, in which he uses both in vitro and in vivo systems. Dr. Ouchi first demonstrated that BRCA1, breast cancer tumor suppressor protein, functions as a co-activator of p53 tumor suppressor protein. Soon after that, Dr. Ouchi's group discovered that BRCA1 also regulates STAT1 transcription factor, establishing that BRCA1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Recently, Dr. Ouchi's group isolated a gene encoding a protein named BAAT1, BRCA1 Associated ATM Activator-1, which is required for the activation of ATM kinase, indicating that BRCA1 is also involved in DNA damage pathway. His group is now working on the mutant mice lacking BAAT1 gene using BRCA1-conditional knockout mice to study the roles of BRCA1-BAAT1 pathway under conditions of DNA damage. Dr. Ouchi's group is tackling the other genetic approach using MMTV-Aurora-A mice. Aurora-A is a Ser/Thr kinase that is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancer. Dr. Ouchi and his collaborators confirmed that Aurora-A causes breast cancer when overexpressed in breast, and found that those tumors contain cytogenetical problems such as aneuploidy. Dr. Ouchi is further conducting translational approach to treat MMTV-Aurora-A mice with specific chemical compounds. These studies are directly linked to the potential therapy of human cancer."O'Halloran	Thomas	PhD	tvo	"<p>Professor O'Halloran's research interests center on the regulatory biology and chemistry of intracellular metal receptors involved in signaling, trafficking and differentiation pathways. Recent work in his group has led to the development of new types of therapeutic agents for the targeted delivery of well established cytotoxic agents (organic and inorganic) to cancer cells.  These ongoing nanotechnology studies have led to new multifunctional anticancer agents.  Research in the OêHalloran lab also focuses on how metals control cellular growth and proliferation.  The interdisciplinary approach employs genetics, structural biology, synthetic chemistry and biochemistry to understand the function of novel intracellular regulatory and trafficking receptors for zinc, copper and iron.  These studies reveal mechanisms of oxidative damage, mechanisms of metal trafficking by metallochaperones  and molecular mechanisms of gene regulation by metalloregulatory proteins. Results from the OêHalloran lab provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms of anticancer drugs, such as those containing platinum and arsenic, and guides the development of agents with improved therapeutic index."Gosiengfiao	Yasmin	MD	ucl535	Van Eldik	Linda	PhD	vaneldik	"Dr. Linda Van Eldik's laboratory focuses on glial cells in the brain, and how         the normal glial-neuronal interactions are disrupted in various diseases.         Current research efforts are aimed toward identification of signal transduction         pathways that mediate aberrant responses of activated glia and elucidation         of mechanisms to down-regulate these detrimental responses. Cancer-related         efforts include investigation of signaling mechanisms in glia that lead         to uncontrolled cell proliferation and development of gliomas in the brain,         with a special emphasis on the role of the calcium binding protein S100         in these mechanisms."Backman	Vadim	PhD	vba990	"<p>Dr. Backman is developing novel biophotonic technologies for early detection, diagnosis, and screening of colon and pancreatic cancer. He has developed four-dimensional elastic light scattering fingerprinting, low-coherence enhanced backscattering spectroscopy, and partial-wave backscattering microscopy to assess nanoscale architecture of living tissue, far beyond what conventional microscopy can reveal. In his studies with two alternate animal models of colon carcinogenesis he demonstrated these techniques diagnose the disease far earlier than it is currently feasible by means of other existing histological or molecular analyses. Furthermore, in pilot human studies he has shown the potential of these techniques to diagnose colon carcinogenesis without the need for colonoscopy."Gelfand	Vladimir	PhD	vge206	"<p>Research in Dr. Gelfand's lab is focused on the molecular and cell biology of motor proteins.  These proteins are the key players in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during cell division and in cell movement.  Microtubule motors move along microtubules and myosins move along microfilaments.  Coordination of motors in living cells and their regulation are main topics of the Gelfand lab. This research is important for understanding cancer cell biology because aberrant regulation of mitotic motors results in spindle abnormalities and errors in chromosome segregation, while abnormalities of motors responsible for cargo transport in interphase cells affect directionality and processivity of cell movement on the substrate and in tissue."Kaklamani	Virginia	"MD, DSc"	vgk331	"<p>Dr. Kaklamani has examined the relationships between polymorphisms of TGF-_ receptor and cancer risk. TGFBR1*6A is one of these polymorphisms which results in decreased TGF-_ signaling. Dr. Kaklamani's research showed that this polymorphism is associated with an increased risk for breast, ovarian and colon cancer.  Individuals who carry this polymorphism have a 50% increased risk for breast cancer. This polymorphism is common and Dr Kaklamani's research showed that it accounts for 15,000 cases of breast cancer yearly in the United States. Furthermore, another polymorphism of the TGF-_ pathway that decreases the TGF-_ signal is also associated with breast cancer. A combination of these two polymorphisms can predict breast cancer risk in a more precise way. This type of evaluation of a cancer related pathway is a novel way of predicting cancer risk."Cryns	Vincent	MD	vlc718	"<p>The Cryns laboratory focuses on molecular mechanisms of apoptosis with an aim towards (1) understanding the apoptosis-resistance of cancer and (2) developing therapeutic strategies to overcome this resistance. To this end, the laboratory demonstrated that the small heat shock protein _B-crystallin protects cancer cells against apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli, including chemotherapy drugs and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), by inhibiting caspase-3 activation. More recently, the lab has demonstrated that _B-crystallin is a novel oncogenic protein that predicts poor clinical outcome in breast cancer. Much of the current work in the laboratory focuses on the oncogenic mechanisms of _B-crystallin, its potential role as a therapeutic target, and its possible clinical utility as a biomarker in breast cancer. The laboratory also has a major interest in apoptotic signaling and has identified several new caspase substrates (e.g., RAD21 and MLH1) whose proteolysis promotes apoptosis. In addition, the laboratory is devising novel therapies to selectively overcome the apoptosis-resistance of cancer by combining TRAIL with a variety of apoptosis-sensitizing agents."Von Roenn	Jamie	MD	vonroenn	"<p>Dr. Von Roenn has a longstanding interest in palliative care and end-of-life issues.

The focus of his research has been two-fold: 1)to initiate clinical trials involving new agents (abraxane, lapatinib, faslodex) for the treatment of advanced and early stage breast cancer. (These trials have been conducted institutionally, through the cooperative group mechanism and with pharmaceutical partners); 2) to develop collaborative efforts within our institution between Breast Cancer SPORE laboratory investigators and clinical investigators. Several projects have been proposed that will be or are being initiated and that will take preclinical observations and translate them into clinical trials in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. These include a study, based on preclinical work by Dr. Hamid Band and colleagues, to test for synergy in the combination of trastuzumab, taxotere, and 17-AAG in women with metastatic breast cancer."Karpus	William J.	PhD	wkarpus	Miller	William	PhD	wmmiller	"<p>Dr. Miller's laboratory is examining the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, lineage commitment, and differentiation. HSC expansion has the potential to produce stem cells for gene therapies, including the introduction of drug resistance genes into normal HSCs to minimize damage to blood cells during chemotherapy. HSC expansion also has the potential to facilitate the use of umbilical cord blood for adult stem cell transplant applications. In collaboration with Dr. Terry Papoutsakis, Dr. Miller is investigating the factors that control lineage commitment and differentiation of HSCs. In particular, they have used knowledge of oxygen tension and pH gradients in the bone marrow to develop physiological conditions to promote or prevent selective differentiation of erythroid, granulocyte and megakaryocyte lineages. The laboratories of Dr. Miller and Papoutsakis are currently using high through put screening of cDNA microarrays to investigate differentiation stage specific gene expression profiles during myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.  The ultimate goal of these studies is to obtain gene expression information that can be used to modulate the differentiation process to modulate number and functionality of ex vivo derived granulocytes and megakaryocytes for therapeutic use."Tourtellotte	Warren	"MD, PhD"	wto456	He	Xiaolin	PhD	xhe850	Li	Xu	PhD	xli714	Wang	Xiaozhong	PhD	xwa760	"<p>Genetic manipulations in mouse embryonic cells provide a very useful platform to unveil in vivo functions of human genes, particularly for those health-related genes such as cancers. The Wang laboratory is mainly working on two areas:  cell-cell adhesion and stem cell proliferation/differentiation. Dr. Wang uses molecular and genetic approaches to study the function of cadherin-like superfamily cell adhesion molecules-protocadherins. Cadherins and their downstream signaling pathways have been implicated in the cause and progression of a variety of human cancers. Using the mouse genetic models developed in the Wang lab, the role of these cadherin-like molecules in the development of brain tumors is under investigation. A second focus of the Wang lab is on understanding the global regulatory mechanisms of embryonic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Elucidating such mechanisms will provide a better understanding the origin and regulation of newly identified tumor stem cells."Wang	Xiao-Qi	"MD, PhD"	xwa833	"<p>Dr. Wang's research focuses on the role of gangliosides on cell behavior. Gangliosides have been considered to be cell membrane targets for cancers treatment, as anti-ganglioside antibody has been applied to treat melanomas in clinical trials and manipulation of ganglioside expression has been used to induce cancer cells apoptosis, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, or prevent cancer cell metastasis in vitro. Gangliosides are sialylated glycosphingolipids located on the outer leaflet of most eukaryotic membranes. Dr. Wang's research has provided evidence of ganglioside alteration in skin cancers and has demonstrated interaction between gangliosides and other membrane receptors (i.e., EGFR, uPAR) that disrupt downstream signaling to modulate epithelial cancer cell behavior. These studies will provide the rationale for new therapeutic modalities aimed at targeting gangliosides together with receptors such as EGFR for treatment of cancer."Yang	Ximing	"MD, PhD"	xya379	Ma	YongChao	PhD	ycm569	Zhu	Yijun	MD	yijun	"Dr. Yijun Zhu's lab is interested in the molecular mechanism by which nuclear        receptors including estrogen receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated        receptor (PPAR) achieve transcriptional activation in a tissue specific        fashion. He has isolated and characterized two novel nuclear receptor        coactivators PBP (PPAR binding protein) and PRIP(PPAR interacting protein).        PBP was found to be a critical coactivator for the functions of nuclear        receptors by gene targeting technique. Furthermore, he revealed that PBP        and PRIP gene are amplified and overexpressed in a significant proportion        of primary breast tumors and breast tumor cell lines."Khalkhali-Ellis	Zhila	PhD	zkh247	"<p>Maspin, a serine protease inhibitor (serpin), is present in high concentrations in normal mammary epithelial (and myoepithelial) cells, but its expression is down-regulated in primary breast cancer and lost in metastatic cells. Dr. Khalkhali-Ellis' efforts have been aimed at identifying approaches to re-express this tumor suppressor and identify its mechanism of action. The maspin promoter contains hormone response elements and AP1 sites and the laboratory is testing the hypothesis that that tamoxifen's anti-tumor action could also be mediated, at least in part, through its ability to induce the tumor suppressor gene maspin. By transfecting maspin promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids into normal mammary epithelial and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, Dr. Khalkhali-Ellis determined the effect of hormones and their antagonists on maspin promoter activity. Her studies revealed that the anti-estrogen tamoxifen induces maspin promoter activity. Interestingly, anti-androgen flutamide could also induce maspin in both cell lines tested. These observations were further confirmed in patient tissues. These novel findings provide a new mechanism of action for tamoxifen under normal and pathologic conditions. More significantly, these findings could have a potential impact on future therapeutic intervention strategies for breast cancer."Lu	Zhidong (Nick)	PhD	zlu119
