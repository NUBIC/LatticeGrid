EMPLOYEE_ID	DESCRIPTION
1000176	Clinical:  Analytical flow cytometry.  I am the Medical Director of Flow Cytometry Laboratory at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  <br><br>Research:  Investigation of the basic cell biology of B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the major research interest of the laboratory. B-CLL is characterized by malignant cells having an anti-apoptotic phenotype and the accumulation of malignant cells is thought to be primarily driven by a block in apoptosis. However, when B-CLL cells are placed in in vitro culture, rapid apoptosis occurs raising the question of whether there are inherent defects in the apoptotic regulatory machinery or whether the dysregualtion seen is due to paracrine and/or autocrine factors. We are currently investigating potential paracrine/autocrine loops regulating apoptosis in the malignant B cell population. Specifically, the potential role of altered cytokine production by tumor specific oligoclonal T cells in these patients and its relationship to apoptosis control in the malignant B cells is being studied.    Although proliferation centers are seen in B-CLL, an additional abnormality is dysregulation of proliferation control in the malignant B cells with few proliferating cells seen in vivo and a lack of proliferative response to a number of normal B cell mitogens. In fact, although non-proliferative, the B cells in B-CLL patients may not be blocked in G0 but rather at a later point in the cell cycle. The other major area of investigation in the laboratory is elucidation of the mechanisms of proliferation dysregulation in these patients.    The laboratory is also involved in development of a number of complex multiparametric flow cytometry based clinical analyses both for diagnostic purposes and for patient specific therapeutic decision/monitoring purposes including assessment of signal transduction pathways in the setting of kinase inhibtor therapies.
1000184	Autopsy pathology, Cardiac pathology<BR><BR>Lipids are important regulators of the activity of many proteins including those involved in cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and neural regulation, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms mediating these effects. My laboratory staff members are engaged in a program of basic research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which lipids act as specific ligands to regulate cellular responses, and to investigate in select areas of cardiovascular disease how aberrations of signaling pathways may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of human disease.We have used the family of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C isoforms as a model to study protein-lipid interactions. Upon stimulation by various hormones these membrane associated enzymes hydrolyze polyphosphoinositides to yield second messengers such diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The determinants of enzyme function are complex and can be broken down into several primary components: substrate binding and catalysis, enzyme translocation, and regulation. During the past several years we have identified the structural motifs in the PLC delta 1 isoform that mediate each of the three primary functions. All three motifs require the binding of a specific lipid for function. The structural motif mediating translocation also modulates the rate catalysis, and is encoded by a unique domain termed the pleckstrin homology or PH domain. This newly discovered protein module of 100 amino acids exists in many molecules (including PLC d1) that participate in signal transduction. Our research is among the first to demonstrate a clear function in signal transduction for the PH domain, and serves a paradigm for the activation and regulation of many signaling molecules.
1000332	My primary focus is the development and application of neuroimaging methods to better understand human development and physiology. Work in the lab draws from many disciplines such as biomedical engineering, physics, biophysics, statistics, electrical engineering, computer science, neuroscience, physiology, biology, and anatomy. While typical development occurs in normal healthy volunteers, a major effort is made to investigate the underlying physiology and function in a variety of disease conditions.

My clinical and research interests focus on Individuals with Primary Progressive Aphasia, Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.  Research projects address the neuropsychological, neuroimaging and neuropathological variables associated with these syndromes, in order to contribute to our understanding of risk and the genetic factors that determine regional brain vulnerability to these diseases and to identify biomarkers that can be used in diagnosis during the patient's lifetime.  To date, there are no biomarkers that definitively predict the type of the neuropathology in these clinical syndromes in the individual patient.  Additional interests in the area of brain aging and its effects on cognition lie in determining factors associated with 'Superaging', the maintenance of a high level of cognitive ability into the 9th decade of life and beyond.

1001887	We have established that in systemic lupus (SLE), the immune system responds abnormally to nucleosomes, the major products of body's own cells undergoing apoptosis (J. Exp. Med. 177:1367, 1993). Our main research programs involve studies on the origins of autoimmune response to nucleosomes, and signaling defects in autoimmune T and B cells that lead to abnormal co-stimulation and apoptosis-resistance. Work is progressing in parallel in lupus patients and mouse models of lupus we developed (Nature 263:412, 1976). We have identified nucleosomal peptide epitopes critical for cognate interactions between the autoimmune T helper (Th) cells and anti-DNA B cells in murine and human lupus (J. Exp. Med. 183:2459, 1996). Recognition of these autoepitopes by lupus T cell receptors (TCR) is highly promiscuous which makes the peptides extremely potent for therapy of established lupus autoimmunity by a mechanism we call 'tolerance spreading'. We have also developed transgenic mice, bearing nucleosome-specific TCR genes, to determine how the autoimmune T cells escape censorship in the thymus despite exposure to apoptosis products, and how they could be regulated in the periphery. Moreover, we found that the Th and B cells of lupus have defects that lower their threshold for costimulatory signaling and make them resistant to anergy induction. These defects lead to sustained production of pathogenic autoantibodies. We are studying new pathways for resistance to anergy and activation induced death in autoimmune T cells of lupus, as revealed by differential gene expression profiling.
1001926	I am interesting in medical education in the field of radiology at multiple levels, as well as overall health care policy and quality. Radiation exposure for medical imaging is becoming a big quality and safety issue. Within the field of radiology I am most interesed in ultrasound. 
1001944	My current research interests lie in 1) understanding the relationship between community factors and clinical ones, particularly related to childhood obesity; 2) early origins of childhood obesity; 3) means to intervene to reduce obesity and its co-morbidities in young children; 4) the effects of community based interventions on obesity prevalence and health behaviors.
1001981	We are primarily conducting translational research, some of which is in conjunction with a colleague in anthropology, Dr. Gillian Bentley.  We have studied hormone differences between populations of women in the developing countries of Bolivia and Bangladesh and the Western countries, US and UK.  Salivary progesterone concentrations are significantly lower in women of developing countries, and migrant studies show that the age of the migrants is critical in the adaptation of the Western hormone patterns.  Adult migrants do not adapt to the higher progesterone levels.  Salivary estradiol is not significantly different between these population groups.  We are interested in the relation of hormone levels to fertility and to breast cancer incidence.  Other studies involve Dr. Seema Khan, Department of Surgery.  We are studying hormone and products of hormone action in nipple aspirate fluid and breast random fine-needle aspirates from women with different levels of breast cancer risk to ascertain the associations of hormones with the potential for breast cancer development.  The very small samples obtained make the procedure more acceptable than other biopsy procedures but the amount of biomarkers in the samples are limiting.  For this purpose we are working with Dr. Chad Mirkin and others in the Nanotechnology Program to develop assays with several-fold greater sensitivities than the current immunoassays.  We are also funded to study the potential for transdermal application of the biologically active metabolite of tamoxifen to the breast as an alternative to oral administration of tamoxifen.  We are working with Dr. Dean Ho of the Bioengineering Faculty to develop more efficient delivery systems for this application.  Potentially, this will eliminate some of the undesirable side-effects of tamoxifen that cause a majority of women to reject the prophylactic use of tamoxifen.

1002030	Dr. Mala Shanmugams research focuses on targeting abnormal glucose metabolism in the hematologic malignancies: multiple myeloma, CLL and mantle cell lymphoma. Elevated glucose consumption is a hall mark of numerous cancers. This phenomenon while forming the basis for clinical imaging of cancer has not yet been targeted for therapy. Dr. Shanmugam has identified a uniquely regulated subset of tumor-specific glucose transporters that facilitate elevated glucose entry in myeloma and are proving to be promising targets for therapy. Suppression of these uniquely regulated/expressed transporters has been found to engage the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis via regulation of specific signaling cascades. Recent work has identified abnormalities in trafficking proteins that enable abnormal plasma membrane localization of these glucose transporters. She is also investigating metabolic reprogramming in resistance mechanisms elicited in response to glucose deprivation. Her research spans from understanding basic mechanism to pre-clinical translational studies in order to target tumor-specific glucose utilization. Dr. Shanmugams research has been funded by the Illinois Division of the American Cancer Society, the Wendy Wills Case Foundation and more recently the National American Cancer Society.

1002062	I have been studying biologic correlates of outcome measures in the context of the US Intergroup CHOP vs. Rituximab(R)-CHOP clinical trial for diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The addition of R to conventional CHOP chemotherapy either as induction or maintenance has now been shown to improve outcome in patients with DLBCL (both US and European trials).  My findings suggest this improvement in outcome is primarily due to the beneficial effect of R added to CHOP in the bcl-6 negative subset of DLBCL. Furthermore, addition of rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy, does NOT benefit patients who are bcl-6+, the majority of cases.  Differences between the clinical behavior of bcl-6 positive and negative lymphoma provide clues to the underlying biologic nature of DLBCL. Different therapeutic strategies may be designed to specifically target bcl-6-positive and negative DLBCL based upon differences in their underlying cell survival mechanisms and sensitivity to chemotherapy and rituximab. Analysis of additional biologic markers (p53, p21) is in progress.  Along with Dr. John Reed of the Burnham Institute, a long-standing collaborator, we are investigating protein expression of paracaspase in  lymphomas.In collaboration with Dr. E. Terry Papoutsakis of the Department of Chemical Engineering, NU, we are creating  gene expression arrays on follicular lymphomas to identify patterns of gene expression reflective of the nonmalignant cells component of the biopsy specimen, and their relationship to clinical outcome.Radioimmunotherapy using anti-CD20 reagents targets radiation to the malignant lymphocytes and their immediate neighbors by means of the cross-fire effect.  To improve outcomes, we have added Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan to conventional BEAM chemotherapy for patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant.  This was an investigator initiated phase I trial conducted under an investigator-held IND.  Colleagues at the Mayo Clinic were our co-investigators.  Forty-three patients were accrued to this study;  the maximal tolerated dose of Y-90-Ibritumomab tiuxetan is one that will deliver 1500 cGy to critical organs.  We are recommending a phase II trial of this radioimmunotherapeutic at 1.0 mCi/kg administering higher doses of Y-90-ibritumomab  tiuxetan be conducted prior to proceeding to a phase III randomized trial.Continuing in our efforts to develop novel therapies for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, I have written a phase I trial to combine bortezomib, the proteosome inhibitor, with Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan for patients with follicular lymphoma. This study has just opened. Other clinical investigations include anti-idiotype vaccines, novel targeted agents such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and new monoclonal reagents such as the  anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody and an anti-CD22 chemoimmunoconjugate. In the context of our recently submitted SPORE in Lymphoma application, I will lead studies of targeted 'nanobins' created by Dr. O'Halloran, and help to develop bcl-6 peptide inhibitors for clinical use with Drs. Licht and Melnick (Albert Einstein).  
1002064	Dr Kahrilas' research focus is on esophageal and oropharyngeal physiology and pathophysiology.  Oropharyngeal studies are aimed at describing the normal mechanics of swallowing and the modifiability that can be imposed therapeutically.  These studies use computerized analysis of manometric and videofluorographic swallowing studies.  Pathophysiologic studies of the oropharynx focus on mechanisms that result in dysphagia and the efficacy of volitional compensatory strategies in modifying these defects.  Esophageal research has centered on the motor activity of the upper esophageal sphincter, peristaltic function, the pathophysiology of esophageal motor disorders, and the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Upper esophageal sphincter investigations utilized manometry and videofluoroscopy to describe reflexive response to esophageal stimuli, as well as normal activity during sleep, acid reflux, meals, and swallowing.  Studies of the esophageal body have described the contractile pattern of longitudinal muscle during peristalsis and are examining the efficacy of peristaltic function in effecting volume clearance and relating this quantitative assessment of peristaltic efficacy to the subjective experience of dysphagia.  Investigations of reflux disease are examining the mechanisms by which anatomic variables, inclusive of but not limited to hiatus hernia, interact with physiological responses to modulate disease severity.  A current research focus is on applying high-resolution solid-state manometry to the analysis of esophagogastric junction pathophysiology both with respect to reflux disease and esophageal motor disorders. Previous research interests have included central nervous system neurophysiology, autonomic nervous system neurophysiology as it relates to sodium homeostasis, and screening for esophageal cancer.

1002617	My overall interests are in mammalian reproduction. In previous years, I studied the regulation of pituitary gondaotropin gene expression and hormone secretion. More recently, I have been working on two topics. The first is trying to determine the genetic cascades involved in male/female sex determination and subsequent development of the gonad. Most of this time is spent on a genome-wide mutagenesis screen for genes involved in spermatogenesis. The second is the control of gene expression by estrogen receptor alpha via mechanisms that do not involve the classical estrogen response element in DNA (the so-called 'non-classical' mechanisms).

1002699	I. The Sonic hedgehog signal in vertebrates is mediated by three C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. Near identity of gene sequence exists between mouse and human GLI1.  We have shown that GLI1 functions as a transcription factor and that a critical domain in the COOH end of the protein is a transactivator with VP16-like structure. We established that GLI1 protein regulates a set of genes that coordinately control proliferation and may in part explain malignant transformation by mis-expression of GLI1. Post-transcriptional regulation of protein levels of GLI1 occur via the 3UTR of the human gene and this is an active area of research in the lab.                    II. The use of genetic mosaics in developmental analysis has been important for over 80 years.  Recently however, it has been possible to use mammalian mosaics and to perform analysis in situ allowing identification of cell lineage in visceral organs.  I used this system to establish that chemical induced tumors and preneoplastic lesions are clonal. The patterns observed in tissues of these animals derive from the allocation of stem cells during development and are the result of the primary forces : cell death, cell movement, and cell division.  We have shown that the patterns are conserved and regulated within the various tissues of the animals examined.  By using a combination of geometric analysis and computer simulation we have shown that the patterns are fractal, likely arise from iterating simple division rules, and do not require cell movement for complex highly variegated patterns to form. One of the prototypical patterns is evident in the cornea where epithelial cells are assorted in a whorled or pinwheel distribution.  We are using a variety of models; rat chimeras, mouse transgenics, live whole animal second harmonic imaging and explant culture to try and understand how this distribution occurs.

1003414	The body of work explores early detection of melanoma by skin self-examination (SSE) by those at risk to develop a melanoma. A research focus is the role of the dyadic relationship in performance of SSE. This research evolved from qualitative research in focus group testing of rulers and magnifying glasses to assist with SSE to a randomized trial of the educational and skills training intervention with qualitative measures by self-reported surveys and diaries.In order to improve the early detection of melanoma by physicians providing care, Dr. Robinson's research seeks to move beyond the usual didactic lectures with skin simulation models. The current model with multiple pigmented lesions affords medical students and primary care resident trainees the opportunity to learn the skills needed for early detection of melanoma. Simulation training modules build selfconfidence as the students and trainees master the skills of early detection of melanoma, counseling the patient, and performing a skin biopsy of a clinically suspicious pigmented lesion. The skin simulation interactive learning will enhance the reliability of healthcare provided by primary care physicians via opportunistic screening.Dr. Robinson's research interest over the last decade has also included prevention of skin cancer by harm reduction messages and educational interventions with teens and young adults with a particular focus on reducing indoor tanning and sun protection.

1004324	Effective psychological treatment today requires a flexibility of approach as well as the ability to ask the right psychological questions. By engaging patients quickly and thoroughly assessing clinical needs and resources, I am able to work with the patient in order to develop the proper mix of problem-focused interventions and more traditional psychotherapy. Each patient's problems and strengths must be evaluated on an individual basis. I view psychotherapy as a collaborative proceess in which the patient(s) and I work together in order to understand how current situations and past influences impact the well-being of the patient's current life and future goals. In addition to using a flexible approach to treatment, when appropriate, I communicate clearly with other professionals involved in treating the patient, couple, or family. I work with adults as individuals, couples, or parents, and with adolescents and families. Having trained in both clinical and developmental psychology gives me a unique life-span perspective in both normal and pathological psychological processes.

1004356	I am interested in identifying why learning becomes progressively more difficult with normal aging. With this broad goal in mind, I am studying the cellular properties of principle neurons of the hippocampus as an animal ages and after an animal has learned a task that involve the hippocampus. Thus far, my colleagues and I have identified that hippocampal pyramidal neurons (the principle output neurons of the hippocampus) become more excitable (that is, they are able to fire more action potentials) following successful learning. More importantly, the same population of neurons become less excitable with normal aging. Thus, it is our working hypothesis that the reduced excitability levels of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons with normal aging is a cause of the learning deficits observed in the aging population. We are currently using state of the art calcium imaging techniques to further characterize the changes in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons following learning and with normal aging. By systematically examining these cellular changes that occur following successful learning and with normal aging, a goal is to identify potential pharmacological targets to ameliorate and/or reverse the normal aging-related cognitive deficits. In addition, given that incidence of Alzheimer's disease increases with age, it is another goal of our research to translate our findings and approach to identify the cellular changes that occur in this debilitating condition.

1004472	Our laboratory has spent the past 15 years seeking to understand the mechanisms of fibrosis that occur in chronic, progressive kidney disease.  We have been studying the role of transforming growth factor (TGF-ﬂ) because it has been associated with a number of kidney diseases.  However, the classically described TGF-ﬂ/Smad signaling pathway is too simple to account for the multiple, sometimes contradictory effects of TGF-ﬂ on cell function. Therefore, we have sought to understand how cell phenotype and the molecular signature of a cell determine whether TGF-ﬂ signaling leads to fibrosis.  We have identified a number of non-canonical signaling pathways that interact with classical Smad signaling, and begun to establish the hierarchy among these pathways.  We are studying the manipulation of these pathways in vitro and in mouse models in an effort to translate our basic findings into therapeutic approaches to halting or preventing the progression of kidney disease.

1005100	Research in the Longnecker laboratory focuses on herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).  These viruses typically cause self-limiting disease within the human population but both can be associated with serious complications. EBV is associated with variety of hematopoietic cancers such as African Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's and adult T-cell leukemia.  EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired cellular immune deficiencies.  The two notable epithelial diseases associated with EBV infection are nasopharyngeal cancer and oral hairy leukoplakia.  Similar to EBV, HSV latent infections are very common in humans.  HSV typically does not cause severe disease but is associated with localized mucocutaneous lesions, but in some cases can cause meningitis and encephalitis. The Longnecker laboratory focuses on several aspects of EBV and HSV replication and pathogenesis.  First, the molecular basis EBV transformation and how it relates to cancer is being investigated. The laboratory is currently screening selective inhibitors that may be beneficial in EBV-associated cancers such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and proliferative disorders that occur in HIV/AIDS and transplant patients.  Second, the laboratory is investigating herpesvirus latency in human host.  In this regard, the laboratory is developing animal models for EBV latent infections. Finally, the laboratory is investigating the function of herpesvirus encoded proteins that are important in for infection and the interactions required with cellular receptors required for pathogenesis. Ultimately, studies by the Longnecker may provide insight for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of herpesvirus infections in humans and better understanding of the herpesvirus life cycle in the human host.

1005265	Our research aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic activation of glia in the brain, especially astrocytes and microglia, leads to damage of the neurons and progressive neurodegeneration in diseases like Alzheimer's disease. The overall goal is to utilize knowledge of potentially 'druggable' pathways to develop new therapeutics. The normal role of the glia is to cooperate with the neurons to keep the brain operating smoothly. When an injury or change in the brain occurs, the glia mount an inflammation response to fight off the insult and restore the brain to its proper functioning. But in neurodegenerative diseases, the glia are over-activated, producing a state called neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation can lead to nerve cell dysfunction or death, which is manifest as dementia. Although neuroinflammation appears to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of neurodegeneration, the molecular mechanisms underlying the process and approaches to downregulate the neuroinflammation have received little attention.

1007168	Dr. Pachman's translational team studies juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), an often chronic pediatric systemic vasculopathy associated with skin inflammation and proximal muscle weakness of unknown etiology. Her laboratory has identified genetic and environmental factors that play a role in the onset of symptoms and govern outcome. The TNF-a-308 promoter A polymorphism is associated with prolonged disease course. Increased production of TNF-a protein is associated with the A allele throughout disease course, in contrast to serum levels of IFN-a activity, elevated early in the disease. Gene expression micro array studies of untreated children's diagnostic muscle biopsies identified massive dysregulation of IFN-a induced genes in JDM, similar to anti-viral immune model, which also shared features of the IFN-a signature characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Epigenetic and miRNA studies of diagnostic muscle biopsies indicate critical differences associated with disease duration. Dr. Pachmans search for clinically useful biomarkers of immune activation has identified CD3- natural killer cells and von Willebrand factor antigen, released from damaged endothelial cells.  With chronic inflammation, progressive endothelial damage is reflected by loss of nailfold capillary end row loops (they developed a quantitative system of analysis)associated with lack of absorption of oral prednisone.  In addition, her lab maintains a patient-derived sample repository of diagnostic muscle and skin biopsies, sequential sera, peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphocyte culture supernatant fluid, and dystrophic calcifications samples keyed to a sequential database and an analytical database software and bio-informatics system. In summary, this intensive research effort broadens the clinical, genetic and immunological characterization of the child with JDM, which is a critical aid in guiding current therapy and may lead to novel targeted interventions.

1007992	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a significant medical condition and current treatment options are ineffective in diabetic patients and in prostate cancer patients treated by prostatectomy.  Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is an essential regulator of penile smooth muscle, cavernous nerve (CN) integrity and CN regeneration that has significant potential to be developed as a treatment to prevent ED by regenerating the CN and by suppressing penile apoptosis.  In our laboratory we examine fundamental mechanisms that underlie cavernous nerve regulation of penile morphology during development, how these mechanisms become altered with peripheral neuropathy of the cavernous nerve in diabetic rats and how manipulation of SHH signaling can be used to speed cavernous nerve repair in diabetic models. 
1008044	Dentin phosphophoryn (DPP), the major noncollagenous protein of tooth dentin matrix is synthesized as dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) by the mesenchyme-derived odontoblasts. We have found a spatio-temporal expression during mouse embryonic development in cells of epithelial origin. At day-13 of embryonic gestation, DPP was localized to the enamel organ at  the developing tooth cap stage, with heaviest immuno-histochemical staining at the oral ectoderm but was also prominent in the inner enamel epithelium. Interestingly, at the same embryonic stage, DPP was also expressed in the ureteric bud branches of the metanephric kidney and in the alveolar epithelial buds of the developing lung. No expression was seen in the mesenchymal component of either organ. Interestingly inclusion of anti-DPP antibodies in E-13 organ cultures of kidneys harvested from wild type mice, altered ureteric bud morphogenesis and caused looseness of the metanephric mesenchyme. These findings suggest that besides its role in mineralization of the dentin, DPP modulates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in meristic tissues during embryonic development.Another focus in our laboratory has been studies directed towards understanding the mechanism of mineralization in vertebrate tissues such as bone and tooth and in sea urchin tooth in invertebrates and the role of extracellular constituents of connective tissue in this complex process.  The acidic protein constituent part of extracellular matrix has been implicated in mineral deposition but the precise series of molecular reaction mechanism remains undefined. In invertebrate systems, where the mineral part is calcite or aragonite the mechanisms of molecular calcification remains even much less understood compared to vertebrates where mineral deposition is chiefly calcium hydroxyapatite. We are studying whether it is the nature of the protein or environment that determines whether we get Calcium Carbonate  or Calcium Phosphate crystals

1008970	The major cause of mortality from prostate cancer is metastatic disease for which there is currently no effective cure.  For reasons that remain incompletely understood, bone is the most common site for prostate cancer metastasis.  Reciprocal signaling between invading prostate cancer cells and host bone stromal cells is central to metastatic tumor development.  Understanding these cell-cell interactions will lead to effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent/arrest metastatic spread of prostate carcinoma. My current research stems from the hypothesis that prostate cancer cells and bone cells interact via the hedgehog signaling pathway to promote bone metastasis.  Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a member of the hedgehog family of ligands that activate an intracellular signaling cascade upon binding to transmembrane receptors (Patched) leading to transcriptional regulation of specific target genes by the Gli family of transcription factors.  Our previous work has demonstrated that Shh-expressing epithelial cells and Gli-expressing mesenchymal cells in embryonic mouse prostate interact via the Shh-Gli pathway to promote cell proliferation and ductal morphogenesis.  We have also shown that the genes for Shh and Gli are expressed in human prostate cancer, and that Shh-expressing prostate cancer cells and Gli-expressing stroma collaborate to promote prostate tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.  Our present research extends these observations and investigates signaling interactions via the Shh-Gli pathway between prostate cancer cells and bone cells to promote prostate carcinoma metastasis, using both in vitro and in vivo models.

1009779	Dr. Pope directs a basic science laboratory, which is focused on rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that affects women much more commonly than men.  Dr. Pope's laboratory has focused on characterizing the basic mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.  The work focuses on the role of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  His studies are directed at defining the mechanisms that promote resistance to apoptosis or programmed cell death.  They are aimed at defining the potential role of the induction of apoptosis as a therapeutic approach in this disease.  To this end his laboratory is characterizing the mechanisms that protect rheumatoid arthritis macrophages and synovial fibroblasts from apoptosis.  Investigators in his laboratory identified the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, Flice Like Inhibitory Protein (FLIP), during monocyte to macrophage differentiation.  They have demonstrated that FLIP is highly expressed in the rheumatoid joint and is responsible for protecting rheumatoid arthritis macrophages from Fas-mediated apoptosis.  His laboratory is further characterizing the mechanisms for the basal expression of FLIP, and that observed following activation by cytokines and toll-like receptor ligands.  Further, studies are aimed at defining the mechanisms of macrophage cell death that occurs following TNF or Toll-like receptor ligation when NF-kB activation is suppressed.  The aim of these studies is to identify potential therapeutic targets for intervention in rheumatoid arthritis.  Additional studies are directed at determining the role of Fas-Fas ligand interactions on the promotion of chronic inflammation, which occurs by sensitizing the macrophages to activation through the Toll/IL-1 receptor pathway.  Additional studies have identified Mcl-1, another Bcl-2 family member, which is critical for the survival of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  Studies have demonstrated that Mcl-1 is highly expressed in the rheumatoid joint, in both macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  Ongoing studies are directed at defining the unique mechanisms that control the expression of Mcl-1 in macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  Both cell types appear critically dependent on Mcl-1 for survival and ongoing studies are aimed at defining the potential role of modulating mcl-1 expression or function as a therapeutic target in experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis.The goal of this program is to develop new therapies, employing apoptosis as a therapeutic tool.  Dr. Popes laboratory also collaborates with Dr. Ramsey-Goldman, developing and performing some of the assays used to evaluate osteoporosis in her patients with lupus.  These include assays to quantitative osteoprotegerin and Rank ligand as well as microarray analysis of monocytes and macrophages from patients with lupus.

Nuclear receptors are transcription factors involved in regulation of many biological processes. In order to initiate transcription, additional factors are required to interact with nuclear receptors and to regulate their activities. These factors are collectively called as nuclear receptor co-factors. Several such co-factors have been identified by our studies. Generating mouse models using gene targeting technology to investigate the functions of these genes is in progress.

1011314	The quality of parent-child relationships during infancy has long-term and significant implications for a child's healthy adaptation. Primary care pediatricians have unique opportunities to support early family relationships because of their repeated encounters with families for well child care. My research and teaching interests have been focused on how emerging parent-infant relationships can be supported by pediatricians and on the impact that the quality of those relationships can have on the practice of primary care pediatrics. In the initial phase of my research, I developed and validated a research protocol for observing and understanding meaningful patterns of interaction that occur between parents and infants during well child visits. Next, I modified the observational system for clinical use, integrated it into Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics training for pediatric residents and studied its influence on recognition, guidance and documentation in well child care visits. My present interests revolve around exploring mechanisms by which the parent-child relationship may contribute to aspects of child health and behavior that are integral to the provision of comprehensive pediatric primary care. I am currently exploring whether there are pathways that include parent-child relationship quality that predict early childhood obesity. I hope this research will lead to identifying families with children at-risk for early obesity who might benefit from early intervention targeting parent-child interactions, parental sensitivity to infant cues and, more broadly, parent-child relationships in lieu of, or in addition to, traditional interventions for obesity. A second line of current research examines parental perceptions and actions around early infant regulation. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship of feeding methods, parenting practices, parent and infant characteristics on the development of infant regulation over the first 18 months.

1011559	Project 1. Atherosclerosis - the main cause of cardiovascular disease - is now understood to result from a chronic inflammation of large arterial blood vessels superimposed upon by high plasma LDL levels, as well as other risk factors. Plasma LDL levels are controlled, in part, by the rate of their clearance from circulation. About 60% of the LDL cleared fron the plasma occurs through the mediation of the LDL receptor, mainly in the liver. The remaining is cleared by an as yet uncharacterized hepatic LDL receptor-independent mechanism. We are currently investigating the possibility that the LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), a trans-membrane co-receptor for Wnt signaling, mediates the clearance of LDL from the plasma. Project 2. Considerable evidence suggests that auto-immunity plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Stephen Miller (Microbiology) we are investigating the effectiveness of tolerance-induced by atherosclerosis-specific antigen-coupled cells in preventing the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in mouse-models of this disease. .

1011901	At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Dr. Slutzky sees both general neurology and epilepsy patients. In addition to his clinical responsibilities, Dr. Slutzky pursues research interests in neural prosthetics, specifically brain-machine interfacing (BMI).  A device that records signals from the cerebral cortex, decodes them, and uses them to control a variety of outputs such as a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or electrically-stimulated muscles in a paralyzed limb, a brain-machine interface could allow a severely motor impaired patient (quadriplegic or locked-in, for example from ALS or spinal cord injury) to interact with his or her environment and potentially regain the use of a limb again. In addition, this technology provides a powerful new way to study normal in vivo brain physiology. Dr. Slutzkys ultimate goal is to refine BMIs to the point that they can safely and effectively be used in humans for long-term applications. He recently received a NIH K08 career development award to investigate different brain signal sources as inputs to a BMI.
1011912	Woodruffs role in understanding inhibin fluctuation in the ovary led to questions about ovarian follicle formation and persistence, which provides new ways to think about fertility preservation for young women with fertility-threatening conditions (NEJM, 2009).  She examined the regulation of follicle function in vitro and established a collaboration with a biomaterial scientist, Lonnie Shea, to develop a 3-dimensional support system that would provide the necessary bio-integrity for follicle growth (Tissue Eng. 9:1013, 2003; News and Views in Nat. Med. 14:1178, 2008 and Nat. Med. 14:1182).  These studies have been very productive and the current culture system supports live births of mice. The system is being adopted to non-human primate and human ovarian follicles. She coined the term oncofertility to describe this work.  Finally, she has used physiological studies together with mathematical modeling to explore the kinetics of follicle formation and persistence in the mouse (Dev. Biol. 298:149 and Dev. Biol. 298:132). These studies reveal the necessary and sufficient nature of the initial follicle pool established in the ovary during the time of development (Nature Med, 14:1190, 2008). Hallmarks of Woodruff career have included a strong focus on ovarian biology, on interdisciplinary approaches to problems, and application of the overall health of women.

1012336	Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus which latently infects the majority of adults.  Reactivation of latent virus occurs frequently, and in immunocompromised individuals, such as recipients of solid organ and bone marrow transplants, reactivation of CMV is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The primary focus of research in our lab is the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which cytomegalovirus (CMV) establishes latent infection, in which the DNA is present but no virus is produced, and the mechanisms by which the virus reactivates, starts actively replicating and induces disease in vivo.  Using murine CMV as a model system, our studies have shown that the virus establishes latency by shutting down viral gene expression through recruitment of transcriptional repressors to the viral genome.  We have developed a unique kidney transplant model for studying reactivation of the virus which closely approximates clinical settings in which reactivation occurs, and we are investigating molecular signaling pathways that lead to transcriptional reactivation of viral gene expression.  This may lead to identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention which could prevent reactivation of CMV and its associated pathologies.

1012563	The overarching goal of my involvement in translational research is to improve the outcome of patients with lymphoma.  With scientists in the US and abroad, we are currently investigating novel signaling pathways in lymphoma, using cell lines and animal model systems.  More specifically, our research focuses on the biology of reactive oxygen species signaling pathways in lymphoma.  Active investigations include: 1) the biology of the lactone diterpenoids in lymphoma; 2) the development of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and curcumin loaded nanodisks as a drug delivery vehicle in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), in collaboration with investigators from the Childrens Hospital Research Institute (CHORI) in Oakland, CA  3) The characterization of cholesterol efflux pumps as a target in lymphoma, in collaboration with Dr Colby Shad Thaxton from the Department of Urology and the Northwestern University Center of Cancer Nanotechnology excellence; 4) the study of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in lymphoma, in collaboration with Dr. Paul Schumacker. Clinical research interests include the study of novel immune stimulatory strategies following stem cell transplant in lymphoma with collaborators in Israel, Europe and the US, new approaches to the use of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in lymphoma, and new treatment paradigms based on the basic investigations described above  Clinical research studies are carried out through the Northwestern University Lymphoma Program and through national co-operative groups such as the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), SPORE programs in lymphoma and through the NCI Phase II Consortium in collaboration with investigators at the University of Chicago.

1012598	The Barrett lab investigates mechanisms of epithelial stem cell activation in mouse and human models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Areas of interest include studying the cooperation between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Wnt in activating beta catenin signaling (He et al Nat Gen 2007). We find that intestinal inflammation increases PI3K-activated beta catenin in intestinal epithelial progenitor and stem cell populations. We propose that this pathway will be a novel target in strategies for chemoprevention (e.g. colitis-induced cancer) and recovery from radiation-induced stem cell injury (e.g. after nuclear attack). In all projects of the lab we strive to have strong translational components by testing lab-generated hypotheses in patient material.

1013559	Being on the pioneering team of lasers in dental surgery and from co-authoring the first textbook on the subject, I have always been interested in Lasers and their clinical use in dental surgery. Also, their effects on tissues versus those effects of more conventional means and how lasers improve the quality of life of our patients.  I have another large interest in the use of Connective Tissue for Dental Surgical Grafting and further its use via minimally invasive surgical techniques.  With connective tissue we are now able to make complete repairs on exposed roots of teeth. With the Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft and with the correct indicators we can create for a 100 per cent repair of tissue and bone and hence complete root coverage and the saving of teeth and surrounding structures.  Also, the use of mathematical formulas to create for correct width to length ratios when creating surgical aesthetic crown lengthening procedures as part of surgical-restorative procedures and reconstruction.  Finally, the use of immediate dental implants and their placement relative to the extraction socket and via the use of a minimally invasive technique (an atraumatic incisionless-flapless-no suturing technique) to yield predictable restorative outcomes and hence better aesthetics, minimal pain, bleeding and swelling and therefore a better quality of life for our patients.

1014980	My primary research focus at FSM is placed on understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying endogenous mediator-mediated protection against tissue injury and regulation of immunity at intestinal mucosa.  I have established and sustained an R01 research program in the area of gastroenterology.  My research group has shown that: (1) Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), a goblet cell-derived protein, protects intestinal epithelial cells against injury through an NF-kappaB dependent mechanism.  Furthermore, we demonstrated that TFF3 triggers a transient activation of NF-kappaB and prolonged upregulation of Twist protein (a molecule essential for downregulation of NF-kappaB activity in vivo) in intestinal epithelial cells via an ERK kinase-mediated pathway. (2) Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8, macrophage-derived protein) promotes the migration of intestinal epithelial cells through a PKCepsilon-dependent mechanism.  It plays an important role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis and the promotion of mucosal healing. (3) Peptidoglycan, a potent immune adjuvant derived from bacterial cell walls, is taken up and crosses intestinal barrier by crypt-based immature intestinal epithelial cells.  Furthermore, we defined a novel cellular mechanism/pathway through which intestinal luminal peptidoglycan is transcytosed across intestinal epithelia.  In addition, we revealed that the absorbed peptidoglycan targets macrophages, which may facilitate intestinal immune homeostasis.  Together, our findings in conjunction with previous investigations, have elucidated molecular mechanisms underlying the trialogue occurred among lumenal contents, epithelial lining, and cells in lamina propria that directs process for the maintenance of intestinal barrier homeostasis, integrity, and immunity.

1018246	The long-term goal of my lab is to identify and investigate molecules that play important roles in mammalian hearing, thus to enrich our understanding of cochlear physiology, and to further develop a better strategy to prevent hearing loss.  Outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for providing high sensitivity and frequency selectivity of hearing.  They are also the most vulnerable cells in the inner ear and are involved in most sensorineural hearing loss that affects the hearing of millions of people.  It is known that OHC death is strongly connected with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Yet, it is not fully understood why OHCs, as compared to other cells in the organ of Corti, are more vulnerable to ROS.  The main function of OHCs is to amplify mechanical signals through their somatic electromotility.  This exclusive property is executed by a unique motor protein called prestin (Zheng et al., Nature, 2000).  We are currently investigating prestins protective role against oxidative stress in the ear using different prestin-expressing cell lines and prestin-knockout/prestin-knockin animal models.  We are focused on understanding the molecular mechanism of motor protein prestin using various cellular, biochemical and molecular biological methods including high throughput small molecule compound library screening procedures.  These studies will not only expand knowledge of prestin as the OHC-based cochlear amplifier at the molecular level, but also produce a deeper understanding of mechanisms associated with outer hair cells loss, and may offer new methods for the prevention of OHC damage.

1018731	In my laboratory we study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of immunopathogenesis of T cell-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases, the chemokine regulation of cell migration and host responses to mucosal bacterial infection, and the role of chemokines in the migration of B cell lymphoma.  The laboratory employs two mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS): Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease (a virus-induced model of MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (an autoimmune model of MS). In particular, the laboratory is examining the chemokine and chemokine receptor biology of T cell, monocyte, and dendritic cell recruitment during CNS demyelinatingdisease.  In addition, we are examining the balance between cellular and molecular mechanisms of oral tolerance induction and generation of mucosalimmunity/host defense to bacterial and viral pathogens.  Finally, the laboratory uses a model of murine B cell lymphoma to study the mechanisms of tumor cell migration to lymphoid and extra-lymphoid tissues. The approaches utilized in the laboratory are applicable to both the understanding of basic biologic mechanisms of disease progression and treatment of autoimmune diseases, enhancement of immunity to pathogens, and treatment of cancer.

1020328	My work focuses on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).  This large family of nearly 1000 receptors is responsible for critical signaling components in normal cellular physiology responses such as differentiation, chemotaxis, and apoptosis.  In fact, nearly half the drugs an the market today are directed at members of this important family of receptors.  I study how they signal to the cognate partner, the heterotrimeric G protein using novel tools (ie US patent6,559,128) as well as other signaling partners such as arrestin.  A key part of my research is directed at allosteric modulators, compounds which can modulate GPCR signaling at a site distinct from the ligand binding site.

Professors David Engman, MD, PhD, Conrad Epting, MD, and Bria Coates MD, lead the team.  TROPICAL DISEASE RESEARCH. Trypanosomes are single-celled parasites that cause human illnesses such as African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease. These illnesses cause tremendous morbidity and death among millions in the tropical world and Chagas is an emerging infection in the U.S. with an estimated half-million infected residents. We study the molecular genetics and cell biology of these organisms both to understand fundamental processes of cell function and to identify novel targets for drug discovery. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH. A variety of infections and other insults to the heart can cause cardiac autoimmunity, a process by which the immune system mistakenly attacks the heart as if it were an infectious agent. We study both infectious and purely autoimmune models of autoimmune myocarditis in a global effort to understand the development of autoimmunity and mechanisms of autoimmune tissue destruction, and to use this knowledge to develop novel strategies to prevent autoimmune damage. We are also interested in the interactions of infectious agents and cells of the immune system with the endothelium, the lining of blood vessels across which both need to cross to mediate or fight disease.

1021762	The research in my lab is centered on the espins, a novel family of multifunctional actin-bundling proteins, and the elucidation of their roles in the organization and function of the actin cytoskeleton of hair cell stereocilia and sensory cell microvilli. Espins are produced in multiple isoforms from a single gene. They are present in the parallel actin bundle of hair cell stereocilia and are the target of mutations that cause deafness and vestibular dysfunction in mice and humans. For example, the jerker frameshift mutation in the espin gene of mice causes recessive hereditary deafness and vestibular dysfunction accompanied by abnormal stereociliary morphogenesis and accelerated stereociliary degeneration. In particular, the stereocilia of jerker homozygotes, which lack espin proteins, fail to increase in diameter, suggesting that espins are required for the appositional growth of the stereociliary parallel actin bundle. Espins are also present at high concentration in the microvilli of taste receptor cells, solitary chemoreceptor cells, vomeronasal sensory neurons and Merkel cells, raising the possibility that these proteins play important, general roles in the microvillar projections of vertebrate sensory cells. Unlike other actin-bundling proteins found in the microvilli and stereocilia of vertebrates, espins are potent actin-bundling proteins that are not inhibited by calcium ion. In addition, espins are unusually effective at over-twisting actin filaments in parallel actin bundles and can do so even at low stoichiometry. In cells, espins efficiently elongate parallel actin bundles and, thereby, help determine the dimensions of microvilli and stereocilia. Espins can also bind actin monomer via their Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domain in vitro and in vivo and can assemble actin bundles in cells. These biological activities distinguish espins from other actin-bundling proteins and may make them especially well-suited to sensory cells.

1022350	Autopsy pathology, Liver and pancreatic pathology<BR><BR>Our current work focuses on the molecular mechanisms responsible for PPAR action. Transcription of specific genes initiated by transcription factors/nuclear receptors is a complex process and involves the participation of multiprotein complexes composed of transcription coactivators. Coactivators contain one or more highly conserved LXXLL (L, leucine; X, any amino acid) motif for direct interaction with AF-2 (activation function 2) region in nuclear receptor.  Our laboratory cloned PBP, PRIP, PIMT, PRIC285 and PRIC320 using either yeast two-hybrid screening or by isolating receptor binding proteins and their identification by MALDI-TOF analysis. We are generating gene knockout mouse models to elucidate the role of these coactivators in the regulation of specific gene transcription. Our work demonstrated that the deletion of PBP, PRIP PIMT and PRIC320  genes in the mouse results in embryonic lethality, indicating that these are vital for development and they alter the function of many nuclear receptors and other transcription factors during critical developmental stages. Recent developments in the area of conditional targeted somatic mutagenesis have opened new avenues for analyzing the physiological functions of coactivator signaling in a variety of tissues and cell types during early development and in the adult.

1025933	The research goal of myself, with the Schnaper lab, is to elucidate a cellular mechanism by which renal fibrosis progress and to seek for potential therapeutic/preventive approach, with focus on molecular mechanisms for function of a fibrogenic cytokine, TGF-ﬂ. Due to a pleiotrophic nature of this cytokine, multiple factors other than directly downstream transcription factor, Smad, are involved in its regulation.   I have characterized several of those pathways using cultured kidney epithelial or mesangial cells as model systems. My recent work that connected those signaling events with a function of cellular receptor of the extracellular matrix, integrins, has added a new dimension to the project.  The lab is now applying our previous findings in vitro in a mice model of renal fibrosis. Our recent data (unpublished) show that the renal fibrosis in this model is dependent on both TGF-ﬂ and PI3K pathways.  Interestingly, a d isoform of PI3K appears to play a role for podocyte damage, whereas up-regulation of TGF-ﬂ followed by the initial podocyte damage mediates fibrotic processes.   These data are critical to further understanding of multiple steps involved to achieve final image of renal fibrosis.

1026398	Dr. Whitington's research involves the study of immune mechanisms of pediatric liver diseases.  Our lab has identified an alloimmune mechanism of fetal liver injury, a process we call gestational alloimmune liver disease, which is the cause of most or all cases of neonatal hemochromatosis and is the likely cause of most cases of liver failure in the first 3 months of life.  We also suspect it to be a major cause of intrauterine fetal demise.  We are also investigating the immune mechanisms of biliary atresia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, as well as mechanisms of fibrogenesis (a byproduct of immune activation) in genetic cholestasis, neonatal hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and hepatic allografts.

1026407	Research activities of our group focus on two major clinical areas: musculoskeletal pain and bone.  In the area of musculoskeletal pain, the development and characterization of analgesic agents for the management of osteoarthritis has been a major focus for over the past decade.  We have helped design and implement phase 2 studies of many of the major classes of drugs currently in use, including NSAIDs, cox-2 selective inhibitors, opioids, topical analgesic agents and novel approaches to pain including antibodies to NGF (nerve growth factor) and other agents active on the peripheral nervous system.  In the areas of chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis, our group has worked closely with Dr. A. Vania Apkarian in the Department of Physiology to describe and understand spontaneous chronic pain with a particular focus of the role of the cerebral cortex.  Current NIH-funded studies are evaluating the transition that occurs in some individuals who progress from acute to chronic pain in order to understand the changes that occur with the hope of eventually being able to modulate cortical activity to produce better clinical outcomes.Bone loss is known to be a major problem for individuals with disabilities, particularly those who are not able to ambulate or bear weight normally.

1027443	The Bohn lab is developing gene and stem cell therapies for Parkinsons disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)using experimental rodent models of these diseases. Previous studies  focused on gene therapy with the neurotrophic factor, glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) which the group has shown slows the progression of dopamine neuron loss in rat models of PD.  A phase I clinical trial testing GDNF gene therapy will commence soon. The lab is currently studying viral vector mediated gene silencing of alpha-synuclein, a gene linked to familiar forms of Parkinsons disease.  In addition, the lab is generating neuroprogenitor-like cells and neurospheres from rat and mouse bone marrow and determining whether this interesting source of stem cells can be developed as a novel therapy for PD.  Studies of the effects of rat bone marrow derived neurospheres are also being tested for effects on traumatic brain injury.  Viral vectors harboring neurotrophic factors are also being made for studies aimed at reversing aging of dopamine neurons in rat hypothalamus and targeting upper motoneurons in mouse models of ALS.  The experimental approaches in the lab are multi-faceted and employ techniques ranging from making viral vectors to molecular and morphometric assays  to behavioral testing.

1029930	My current research focus is on characterizing the signaling pathways that regulate endothelial cell behavior leading to the process of blood vessel development (angiogenesis).  In particular, I am interested in characterizing the role of the a4 laminin subunit, a component of the basement membrane of endothelial cells in blood vessel development.  I have previously demonstrated that a4 laminin contributes to angiogenesis by interacting with avb3 integrin and b1 integrin containing heterodimers.  I plan to further unravel the signaling mechanisms underlying a4 laminin dependent angiogenesis, to identify the critical phosphorylation events and to determine the role of apoptosis in the endothelial cell response to a4 laminin.  I am also interested in characterizing the signaling pathways that are involved in either enhancing or blocking the differentiation process of endothelial progenitor cells to endothelial cells.  Endothelial progenitor cells have been implicated in the development of new blood vessels during normal and pathological angiogenesis.  However, the mechanism and extracellular signals that initiate and regulate this process are poorly understood.

1030041	Dr Kuikens research group is working developing bionic technologies to improve the function of artificial limbs for people with very proximal amputations.  The main research focus of the lab is developing a technique using nerve transfers to improve of myoelectric prosthesis control called targeted reinnervation.  By transferring the residual arm nerves in an upper limb amputee to spare regions of muscle it is possible to make new signals for the control of robotic arms. This allows simultaneous control of multiple joints in a natural way.  The procedure has been very successful in patients with increases in speed of 50- 500%. Similarly, hand sensation nerves can be directed to reinnervate spare skin in or near the residual limb so that when this skin is touched, the amputee feels like their missing hand is being touched including light touch, graded pressure hot/cold, sharp/dull and vibration. This is an exciting pathway to producing true sensory feedback to amputees from their prosthesis.

1031304	My research focuses on spinal motor-system. I am interested in the interaction between pre-motor interneurons and motoneurons; the synaptic plasticity of motoneurons for peripheral and brainstem descending pathways; and the mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Using a root recording system I developed for mouse spinal cord study, I have demonstrated the existence of two forms of short-term plasticity in the spinal motoneurons in response to different source of synaptic inputs. Further studies in this direction will move toward the cellular level to understand their pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms.  In an animal model of ALS (mSOD1 mouse), I have found that NMDA receptors in the spinal interneurons might be an important component contributing to motoneurons' excitotoxicity. Further studies will apply intracellular recording and calcium image techniques to answer that through what ions, channels and/or receptors the interneurons interact with motoneurons in mSOD1 mouse in order to determine new therapeutic targets for this disease.

1033423	Building And Re-Building Of Limbs And Hearts. The Simon Laboratory has identified regulartory genes that play key roles in limb development in virtually all vertebrates, including humans. Surprisingly, these genes are also critical for the shaping of the heart during embryogenesis and when mutated in humans, they lead to birth defects of the arms and heart. Using zebrafish and mouse models, the lab tries to gain a deeper understanding of common genetic pathways in limb and heart development and disease. In addition to these developmental studies, the lab is interested in discovering the genes that are involved in regenerative processes. As models for these investigations, zebrafish and newts are employed, which can regenerate limbs and heart ventricles throughout their life times. The identification of genetic pathways that are operational in these regenerating species but not in mammals, will provide new insights how to restore regenerative abilities in non-regenerating species including humans.

1034453	Our group seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which human prostate cancer cells regulate motility (and thus ultimately metastasis), to identify new drugs which target regulatory elements, and to evaluate their efficacy in humans.  Studies employ basic cell and molecular biology based investigations, animal models of metastasis, and early phase clinical trials involving cell and molecular based endpoints.  A central focus is upon the role of transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) associated signaling members.  Through these studies we have been able to link TGFb super family receptors, Smad proteins, members of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway, small heat shock proteins (in particular, HSP27), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), into an inter-linked regulatory network within the cell, which together regulates cell motility, invasion, and metastasis.  We have identified a lead compound that effectively blocks activation of the key regulatory elements.  Our lead compound inhibits metastasis in murine orthotopic models, was well tolerated in human phase I trials, and demonstrates mechanistically relevant cell and molecular efficacy in phase II human trials.

1034656	A major pediatric research priority and the long-term goal of my laboratory is the identification of the etiology and pathogenesis of Kawasaki Disease (KD), the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed nations. KD can result in coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) formation with resultant myocardial infarction and/or sudden death. Clinical and epidemiologic data are consistent with an infectious cause of KD, but conventional methods have not yielded the etiologic agent. We discovered that oligoclonal IgA plasma cells, CD8 T lymphocytes, and macrophages infiltrate CAA and other tissues in acute KD, indicating an antigen-driven response to an intracellular pathogen, such as a virus, with a mucosal portal of entry. We made oligoclonal KD antibodies in vitro and used them as tools to identify their target antigens. Immunohistochemistry revealed that KD synthetic antibodies detected antigen in acute KD but not control bronchial epithelium and in a subset of macrophages in acute inflamed KD tissues. In acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium, antigen localized to distinctive perinuclear intracytoplasmic spheroids. Light and electron microscopy revealed that the spheroids in ciliated bronchial epithelium were cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (CIB). The CIB were most consistent with aggregates of protein and associated nucleic acid and likely derive from the KD etiologic agent. These data support the hypothesis that the KD agent enters via the respiratory tract, infects bronchial epithelium, and travels in macrophages to targeted tissues including coronary arteries, with antigen-specific IgA plasma cells and other inflammatory cells entering the tissues to combat the pathogen and resulting in tissue damage. The presence of CIB consistent with aggregates of microbial, likely viral, proteins and nucleic acids in acute KD lung provides a structural and molecular footprint that could lead to identification of the KD etiologic agent.
1034762	<BR><BR>My research work is focused on studying the mechanisms that regulate the transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors constitute a large superfamily of transcription factors that regulate a diverse array of biological processes, including development and neoplasia, as well as energy and xenobiotic metabolism. In order to initiate transcription, some more factors are required to interact with nuclear receptors and to regulate their activities. These factors are collectively called 'nuclear receptor co-factors'. Several co-factors have been identified by our studies. Generating mouse models using gene targeting technology to investigate the functions of these genes is in process.

And, in an effort to prepare trainees and investigators to engage effectively in collaborative research and team science, I have recently developed two interdisciplinary, team science training resources: a graduate-level Team Science course and TeamScience.net, an online learning tool.  I am now developing a workshop series focused on leadership and team science.  Finally, I chair the Annual International Science of Team Science (SciTS) Conference, through which I am working to develop a strong, interdisciplinary community of practice for team science, SciTS, and interdisciplinary research training.
1035819	I am committed to a career in patient-oriented research related to pulmonary vascular disease. Exploring the clinical impact and the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with underlying lung disease is my primary research interest. This interest stems from my clinical experience over the last several years developing and building the Northwestern Pulmonary Hypertension Program. Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication seen in patients with lung disease, specifically chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although the association between the presence of PH in COPD and increased mortality has been well described, we have recently explored the impact of PH on patient-centered outcomes. I am interested in exploring the mechanisms of PH and identifying the disease as it presents early in the course of lung disease when interventions could potentially alter disease progression.

We focus on this organism's type III secretion system, an apparatus that injects toxins directly into host cells.  A second interest is the identification of novel virulence determinants.  Our studies utilize a broad range of approaches, including molecular and cellular techniques as well as animal models and epidemiologic studies on human populations.
1036135	The major focus of my academic interest has been the study of newborn vascular biology. I spent my fellowship and early faculty years studying extracorporeal life support (ECMO) in newborn infants under the direction of Dr. Thomas P. Green. I entered the laboratory of Dr. James Russell in 1990 and learned techniques to investigate basic mechanisms regulating vascular tone. I have gone on to apply this knowledge to better understand the normal development of the perinatal pulmonary circulation, and to determine specific abnormalities that result in persistent pulmonary hypertension. My recent work has utilized intact animal and bench approaches to investigate the role of oxidant stress in the vascular dysfunction and remodeling that characterizes PPHN. We have not only identified enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species, but have also shown that antioxidant strategies reverse the physiologic and enzymatic abnormalities of PPHN. In collaboration with Dr. Paul Schumacker, my laboratory group has recently incorporated novel in vitro techniques to better understand specific cellular sources of oxidant stress during hyperoxic ventilation, which paradoxically is the most commonly used clinical treatment for respiratory failure and PPHN. Our work provides the scientific foundation for revising the current AHA recommendations to resuscitate critically ill newborns with 100% O2. I recently served as a lead investigator for a Phase I/II trial of intravenous sildenafil for the treatment of PPHN, and plan to proceed to a randomized multicenter clinical trial of intravenous sildenafil for infants with PPHN, beginning late in 2010.

1036557	Dr. Epsteins laboratory is engaged in the study of the impact of viral infections on the developing nervous system.  Currently we are investigating the role of Human Herpesvirus 6, and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) as potential causes of hippocampal injury during febrile status epilpepticus (FSE).  Dr. Epstein is a co-investigator and the study neurovirologist for the ten year NINDS funded multicenter longitudinal FEBSTAT study of  200 children with FSE.   To date we have found that HHV-6B is the most common cause of FSE in children accounting for nearly 30% of the infants that present with FSE.  This longitudinal study will allow us to determine if FSE caused by HHV-6B or HHV-7 is more likely to result in mesial temporal sclerosis and temporal lobe seizures.  Intractable temporal lobe seizures are the most common reason for epilepsy surgery in adolescents and young adults.   If  HHV-6B or HHV-7 prove to be responsible for hippocampal damage it is possible that the injury could be prevented by treatment with anti-viral or anti-infammatory medications at the time of presentation with FSE.

1039486	I have had a long-standing interest in studying RNA regulatory mechanisms in development.  My lab has focused on studying the mechanism of action of Evfs, novel long non-coding RNAs that regulate transcription factors essential for proper GABAergic interneuron development.  Although a critical role for developmentally regulated transcription factors in patterning and differentiation has been established for some time, the role of long, polyadenylated non-coding RNAs (lpncRNAs) is only beginning to be understood.  A handful of lpncRNAs play roles in X-inactivation, imprinting, and germ cell development, raising the question of whether lpncRNAs constitute a common or rare gene regulatory mechanism in the developing embryo.  We recently showed that the novel lpncRNA, Evf2 is conserved across vertebrates (ultraconserved), and is a sonic hedgehog target in the developing forebrain.  We also showed for the first time that the lpncRNA Evf2 complexes with the Dlx2 homeodomain transcription factor and regulates Dlx 5/6 enhancer activity in vitro (Feng et al. 2006).  Through analysis of an Evf2 loss-of-function mouse model developed in my lab, we now find that the Evf2ncRNA is not only required for proper regulation of genes in the Dlx 5/6 region, but also for proper GABAergic interneuron development in the embryonic brain and adult hippocampal circuitry (Bond et al. 2009).  This provides a novel mechanism in which a DNA regulatory element is regulated by a complementary lpncRNA critical for proper interneuron development. Future work focuses on the mechanism of Evf2-dependent interneuron loss and mechanisms involved in long ncRNA transcriptional control. In addition, the importance of GABA in orchestrating multiple developmental events and maintaining homeostasis in adult brain circuitry is leading us to test whether Evf2-mutants exhibit specific behavioral phenotypes.  Results support the idea that a single ncRNA controls a  complex behavior.

1040637	Anatomic Pathology, Neuropathology, Neuromuscular pathology<BR><BR>The early growth response (Egr) family of transcription factors are involved in cellular growth and differentiation and may play a role as initiation and propagation factors in some cancers. A major focus of our research is to understand the role of Egr transcription factors during development of the mammalian nervous system. We and others have discovered that these transcription factors regulate a variety of developmental processes including hindbrain organization, peripheral nerve myelination, sympathetic nervous system development, male and female fertility, induction of late phase long term potentiation (a form of synaptic plasticity) and muscle mechanoreceptor development. In the nervous system, Egr transcription factors are downstream signaling mediators of neuronal activity and growth factor molecules known as neurotrophins. We are actively exploring their role in mediating a variety of neurotrophin actions that include neurite outgrowth, synaptic vesicle protein regulation and muscle stretch receptor development. As plasticity related transcription factors, Egr genes are important for mediating nervous system adaptation to a variety of developmental and environmental stimuli. Egr transcription factors are also essential for some non-nervous system related developmental processes. For example, they are involved in monocyte and thymocyte development, and they are involved in growth and differentiation of pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma tumors. Using these model systems of differentiation, we are exploring the varied developmental pathways and target genes regulated by Egr transcription factors to elucidate their roles in cancer and developmental biology.

1041441	My research agenda lies in the area of Experimental and Clinical Neuroscience, and involves mainly the study of spinal neuronal mechanisms/circuits coupled with motor control and locomotion. The main driven force for my studies is to better understand the functional units of motor control in humans so to develop rehabilitation protocols that promote sensorimotor recovery in people with a spinal cord injury (SCI). I employ non-invasive electrophysiological techniques incorporating also engineering elements to fully describe the above concepts. Currently, my research studies are concentrated on examining the reorganization of spinal reflex circuits after intensive locomotor training in people with SCI.

1041624	Our research closely links to the clinical problem of pressure induced soft tissue injury, commonly seen as the pressure sore in SCI individuals. To test our hypotheses that the mechanical properties are altered in wounded and denervated tissues, soft tissue samples (skin, fat, muscle) freshly collected from able-bodied, SCI individuals, and wounded tissues are being tested for compressive mechanical properties. Rat models of chronic SCI and pressure sore are being used to characterize the mechanical property change in vivo and ex vivo. A finite-element model for buttock-thigh has been developed specifically for the condition of sitting, is used as a tool to bridge the lab-acquired basic knowledge of the soft tissues and the clinical problems in reality. The effect of different sitting configuration on the buttock-thigh tissue loading, tissue perfusion, and skin temperature elevation are evaluated. We found that sitting greatly impeded tissue perfusion in buttock tissue and the pressure relief push-ups did not provide adequate recovery for tissue perfusion. Also, SCI individuals needed longer time for buttock tissue perfusion to recover after a long time sitting. We developed an Intelligent Automated Pressure Relief Seat  IAPRS which detects the seat-buttock contact and automatically relieves the buttock loading by lowering down the back part of the seat. IAPRS is being tested in clinical setting on SCI individuals and sitting related pressure sore. Preliminary results show that IAPRS promotes the pressure ulcer healing in sitting area, while maintaining the mobility for wheelchair users during the treatment of pressure ulcers. To test the feasibility of early detecting of pressure induced deep tissue injury under intact skin; an ultrasound tissue palpating probe (TUPS) has been adapted for in vivo testing of soft tissue gross stiffness on human subjects and on our animal models to differentiate injured from healthy tissue by detecting their stiffness difference

1042976	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the US, with a median survival time after diagnosis of less than 6 months and a 5-year disease-free survival of less than 5%. Pancreatic cancer is commonly associated with pronounced collagen-rich fibrotic reaction. We have found that there is significant cross-talk between type I collagen and the key proteinase membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) in regulating pancreatic cancer invasion. MT1-MMP is overexpressed in human pancreatic tumors particularly in areas of pronounced fibrosis. To better understand the role of MT1-MMP in vivo, we have created transgenic mice that can be targeted to express MT1-MMP in the pancreas, and have crossed these mice with mice expressing mutant KrasG12D. Excitingly, co-expression of human MMP-14 and K-rasG12D in the pancreas results in large, cystic, papillary lesions consistent with human intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Surprisingly, these lesions have very pronounced fibrotic reaction and are associated with increased TGF-ﬂ signaling and activation of stellate cells. We have also been examining whether the interplay between collagen and MT1-MMP is involved in resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine chemotherapy. Recent reports have suggested that the fibrotic reaction limits the delivery and effectiveness of current therapies in pancreatic cancer. Consequently, my research group has been examining the extent to which type I collagen contributes to gemcitabine resistance. We have found that cells grown in 3D type I collagen are less likely to respond to gemcitabine compared to cells grown atop 3D collagen or on tissue culture plastic. Significantly, we have found that the effect is mediated in part via MT1-MMP. We are currently in the process of characterizing the detailed signaling pathways downstream of MT1-MMP that are involved in chemotherapy resistance in the 3D microenvironment.
1042976	The major focus of my lab is to understand the mechanisms utilized by invading and metastasizing tumor cells to promote expression and activity of extracellular matrix-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The lab currently has two projects. In our oral cancer project, we are interested in understanding how TGF-b1 signaling through Snail family of transcription factors increases MMPs and promotes invasion of oral cancer cells in 2D and 3D organotypic models of oral cancer. We have also established an orthotopic model for oral cancer wherein OSCC cells expressing GFP-tagged Snail or Slug are injected directly into the tongue to examine the role of these key proteins in promoting tumor growth and invasion in the in vivo microenvironment.  In addition to our work in oral cancer, we have also been examining the contribution of fibrosis to pancreatic cancer progression. Fibrosis, also known as desmoplastic reaction, is a very prominent feature of almost all human pancreatic tumors, and earlier reports suggested that this desmoplasia in fact contributed to pancreatic cancer progression. We recently published that the pancreatic cancer cells adjacent to areas of fibrosis exhibit increased expression of membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). We are particularly interested in understanding how the desmoplastic reaction increases the expression of MT1-MMP in the cancer cells, thus enabling the pancreatic cancer cells to invade through a collagen-rich extracellular matrix. In addition to utilizing in vitro models to examine the cross-talk between type I collagen and MT1-MMP, we have also established a transgenic mouse model in which MT1-MMP is selectively and under regulated conditions expressed in the pancreas to examine the effect of MT1-MMP on tumor growth and on the generation of desmoplastic reaction.

I am primarily engaged in active pharmacovigilance, including the detection and assessment of safety signals related to drugs and devices and the timely dissemination of findings to relevant stakeholders. A related research focus is comparative and cost effectiveness analyses of cancer related therapies targeted at older cancer patients and safe and cost-effective transitions of care for this cohort. I am also engaged in a collaborative NCI sponsored minority biobanking/biospecimen collection initiative with colleagues at several comprehensive cancer centers across the country. Future studies in pharmacogenomics are expected to aid in prescribing decisions and will likely predict older cancer patients who will respond appropriately to a given cancer-related medication or experience severe adverse drug reactions.
1043300	Serious adverse drug reactions in elderly cancer patients in the oncology setting are not being regularly identified, evaluated and reported. When adverse events are reported for older cancer patients, the reports are often incomplete and hence causality assignment is delayed, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.A  clinically-based, hypothesis-driven approach to pharmacovigilance will improve the completeness of reporting and the assignment of causality, resulting in improved health outcomes for older cancer patients.In summary, I aim to 1) Identify, evaluate, and report on serious adverse reactions to drugs used in cancer patients age 65 and older;  2) Assess the completeness of adverse event reports for patients 65 years and older and  3) Assess both causality assignment and the timeliness of causality assignment in  patients <65 years with those >65 years

1045466	Our laboratory investigates the role of the nuclear factor Ikaros in T cell development and leukemogenesis. Ikaros is a nuclear factor that is a component of two chromatin remodeling complexes associated with gene activation as well as gene repression.  Genetically engineered Ikaros null mice develop T cell leukemia with 100% penetrance suggesting that Ikaros is a tumor suppressor.  In addition, lack of Ikaros results in multiple defects in T cell development that include a decrease in the number of T cells, an increased potential to differentiate into the CD4 lineage and a complete lack of fetal T cell development. In addition, they are unable to undergo negative selection, a checkpoint that is required to prevent the inappropriate maturation of autoreactive T cells.  In order to determine mechanisms for Ikaros role in T cell biology, we are studying the role of Ikaros in regulating Notch and TCR signaling pathways, as well as in regulating early developmental decisions from the level of early lymphoid progenitors.  We are also interested in investigating the role of Ikaros in regulation of T helper fate decisions during an immune response. 
1045574	I am interested in how early events and environments shape later outcomes of preterm births.  For example, babies who were small at birth seem to be at high risk for complications such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity in adulthood.  Why?

I study prenatal environments such as maternal health, biological markers such as cord blood and placenta, and early neonatal experiences for clues as to and how they relate to later outcomes, especially obesity.  At present, I focus on outcomes during the neonatal period, but eventually I would like to follow growth and health of these babies into adulthood.

1048034	My lab studies the structure and function of ion channels, a family of membrane proteins that play many key roles in neuroscience and which are a major target of essential drugs used in clinical medicine. About a third of all genes in a typical genome code for membrane proteins, yet we know very little about their structure and function. Because ion movement across membranes can be measured with exquisite sensitivity, ion channels have always been at the vanguard of functional studies of membrane proteins, and as a consequence we have learned a great deal about how they function. Until recently, however, ion channels, like so many other membrane proteins, had proven very difficult to study at the structural level. The recent high-resolution description of several ion channels has opened up the field of structure-function in ion channels, and we are now in a position to ask detailed questions about how function is achieved through structure in this essential class of proteins.How do voltage-dependent ion channels sense the membrane potential? Through what structural rearrangements do these channels achieve voltage-dependent ion flow across the membrane? How can highly dynamic proteins maintain such outstanding control of what sorts of ions are allowed to pass? These are some of the questions that we attempt to answer.

1048574	The laboratory is interested in determining the role of intermediate filament proteins (IF) in prostate cancer. There are two main goals. First, can the development and progression of prostate cancer and patient outcome be determined be determined by the IF expression profile. This hypothesis is based on the observations that expression patterns of IF change when cells differentiate. Second, does the organization of nuclear lamins in prostate cancer cells affect DNA replication and transcription. We have previously determined that lamins directly bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen and expression of dominant negative mutant lamins affects DNA replication. Furthermore, we have shown that lamin expression affects RNA Pol II transcription. Nuclear microdomains can also influence the transcription potential of chromosomes in the region.

1048762	Cells contact and communicate with their neighbors via specialized cell surface receptors.  This intimate exchange of information controls morphogenetic events during embryonic development and maintains tissue organization in adults.  Birth defects and cancer commonly result when cells fail to recognize and respond appropriately to their environment.  The work in my laboratory is guided by the hypothesis that epithelial cells receive and interpret contextual information through the coordination of adhesion and signaling receptor systems present on the cell surface.  To test this idea, we manipulate the ability of epithelial cells to interact with one another and measure their capacity to transduce intracellular signals that regulate cell fate and behavior.  In parallel, we assess the potential of cell surface signaling receptors to alter the manner in which epithelial cells adhere to their partners.  A three-dimensional in vitro model of the human epidermis is used to help define these adhesion-signaling networks during epithelial tissue morphogenesis.

1050302	Our laboratory studies the neuroinvasive herpesviruses with a focus on the molecular mechanisms by which these pathogens propagate and disseminate within the nervous system. The outcome of infection is closely tied to the route the viruses spread within the nervous system, with outcomes typically relative benign but sometimes producing blindness and lethal encephalitis. We use a combination of live-cell fluorescence microscopy, molecular genetics and neuronal cell biology to examine the dynamics of viral particle assembly and intracellular axon transport. These molecular mechanisms are then examined in the larger context of neuroinvasion and pathogenesis. Two long-term goals of our research are to identify novel targets in the viral infectious cycle for development of antivirals, and engineering recombinant viral particles as effective gene delivery vehicles.(Keywords: neuron, axon, microtubule, cytoskeleton, dynein, kinesin, transport, virus, virion, herpesvirus, herpes, capsid, tegument, egress, nucleus, GFP, BAC, bacmid, recombination, GS1783)

1050787	The principal focus of this laboratory is the examination of the spatial and temporal patterns of motor cortical activity preceding voluntary movement and the function of this activity in shaping and controlling movement initiation.  In particular we are interested in the function of the primary and supplementary motor areas and their interactions with the basal-ganglia in the feedforward and feedback control of movement.  We use a variety of non-invasive techniques to assess these systems in humans such as:  high-resolution EEG recordings and MRI-based source reconstruction techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, multi-channel EMG, and measures of movement kinematics and kinetics.  Experiments are currently being conducted to examine the role of the primary and supplementary motor areas and brainstem in the preparation and release of voluntary movements.Neurological diseases that affect the basal ganglia have a significant impact upon the function of the primary and supplementary motor areas.  For this reason, our research is also focused on the assessment of motor cortical function in neurological disorders such as Parkinsons disease and dystonia.  This work is conducted in collaboration with The Parkinsons Disease and Movement Disorders Center at Northwestern.  We are currently examining the control of repetitive movements in patients with Parkinsons disease and the effects of dopaminergic replacement therapy and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (a neurosurgical treatment for advanced Parkinsons disease) on the control of these movements.
1050821	I am interested in investigating the role of musculoskeletal biomechanics on the upper extremity movement deficits following stroke based on experimental methods and computer modeling.I am also interested in the design of robotic devices for therapeutic applications in stroke.

1051269	Brain functions are the result of the coordinated activity of large networks of neurons, which are composed by many different cell types. As a consequence, the specific properties of synaptic communication between different types of neurons play a pivotal role in shaping the computational power and network activity of specific brain regions. Research in my laboratory is focused on the hippocampus, which is an area of the brain involved in higher cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, and is often affected by important neurological illnesses like epilepsy, schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease. In particular, we are interested in the synaptic properties of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, which are a very heterogeneous cellular population, with wide anatomical and functional diversity. Additionally we are trying to unravel the network properties of Cajal-Retzius cells, which are a neuronal population involved in guiding cortical development, whose computational functions remain poorly understood.Methodologically, we use state-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques in vitro such as paired recordings from anatomically identified connected neurons and optogenetic control of specific cellular populations.We hope that relating different neuronal types to clear network functions may lead to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of hippocampal activity, and generate important insight into the organizing principles of cortical networks in the normal brain and during disease.

Work in radiobiology includes studies of the molecular biology of radiation responses, particularly radiation toxicities, radiation effects, dose-, dose-rate, and radiation quality issues and other general areas of radiobiology. In addition, my laboratory houses the tissues and data from mojority of  the radiobilogical experiments conducted in US between 1950-1990's (http://janus.northwestern.edu). In addition to sharing these data and materials with the radiobiological community, my group is investigating the archive as well; we are applying new statistical approaches on old datasets and new experimental approaches for investigation of formalin fixed and paraffin embedded materials. Work with micro-RNA microarrays, and use of X-ray fluorescence microscopy for histopathological analysis fall into this research.Work in bionanotechnology includes development and investigation of multifunctional nanoconstructs, increasing contrast for biomedical imaging (MRI and CT), enabling delivery of small molecules (such as chemotherapeutic drugs, flavonoids etc.) and producing cytotoxic reactive oxygen species to fortify effect of radiotherapy.

1051485	Our laboratory studies the regulation of DNA Replication during the cell cycle. 
1051485	We study how stem cell division and differentiation are coordinated.  Cell division and differentiation are in many ways mutually exclusive. Most cells stop dividing as they adopt a specific fate, while relatively undifferentiated stem cells are able to divide throughout the lifetime of the organism. Cancer cells are characterized by both poorly controlled proliferation and a loss of the differentiated phenotype. During regeneration, quiescent differentiated cells revert to a stem cell phenotype and begin dividing anew.  Our research focuses on hematopoietic stem cells, germline stem cells, and myocardial stem cells.  Our central approach is to construct knockout mouse models to study proteins that regulate stem cell division and differentiation patterns.  We also study the mechanism of nuclear reprogramming using Xenopus eggs.

1051610	The research interests of my group are in the field of cytokine-signaling in malignant cells.  We have previously identified and characterized several novel signaling cascades activated by the Type I interferon receptor downstream of Jak-kinases in leukemia and other neoplastic cells, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-pathway, the Crk-pathway and the p38 Map kinase signaling cascade.  These studies have been expanded in efforts to determine the mechanisms by which chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells become refractory to the antiproliferative effect of interferons and the mechanisms of synergy between interferon and STI571 (Gleevec) in CML cells.  We have also recently identified the kinase that mediates phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727 as the protein kinase C-delta (PKC&#61540;).  Other research areas in which our laboratory is actively engaged are the mechanisms of signal transduction of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia.  We have recently shown that ATRA activates the Rac1/p38 Map kinase pathway and that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway enhances its effects on leukemia cells, raising the prospect of development of translational studies combining ATRA with pharmacological inhibitors of Map kinases for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.  Finally, our group also studies the signaling mechanisms of regulation of normal hematopoiesis by myelosuppressive cytokines, including interferons, tumor necrosis factor-alfa and transforming growth factor-beta.

1051734	The laboratory has a long standing interest in the biology of epithelial stem cells. To this end, in collaboration with Tung-Tien Sun (NYU Medical School) we have identified and characterized epithelial stem cells of the epidermis, corneal epithelium and hair follicle      Another research focus of the laboratory is the characterization of epithelial-enriched  microRNAs (miRNAs) to understand how these miRNAs regulate epithelial stem cell behavior and epithelial differentiation. We have demonstrated the presence of several miRNAs that are specifically localized in the corneal epithelium of adult mice; other miRNAs are found in many stratified squamous epithelia including the epidermis. Recently we have found that the lipid phosphatase SHIP2 is a target for miRNA- 205 (miR-205), which is expressed in many stratified squamous epithelia. We have also found that miR-184, which is exclusively found in the corneal epithelium, antagonizes miR-205 to help maintain the levels of SHIP2. This is the first example of a miRNA negatively regulating another to maintain levels of a target protein. 
1051743	My current research interests include radiation biology and nanotechnology and development of a new instrument for high resolution microscopy--Bionanoprobe. In the field of radiation biology, my primary focus is on mechanisms underlying development of genomic instability caused by ionizing  irradiation. This investigation includes work with cells in culture and animal models as well as exploration of archival animal tissues collected from large scale animal experiments, currently located in Woloschak laboratory.My efforts in the field of biomedical nanotechnology include development and investigation of nanoconstructs suitable for biomedical imaging and cancer therapy. Different metals and metal oxides are combined to form the compact center of nanocomposites; their outer layer(s) are made by conjugation of biomolecules and small molecules which enable nanoconstruct targeting and use in vitro and in vivo. Study of interactions between nanoconstructs and cells and tissues requires high throughput and high resolution imaging that co-registers both biological material and nanoconstructs. Only technique that can fulfill all of these requirements is X-ray fluorescence microscopy. A grant awarded to our laboratory was used for custom construction of unique new instrument--Bionanoprobe. This instrument is now installed at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron and will be used for imaging for bio-nanotechnology.

1052190	Dr. Chetkovich practices general neurology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and at the Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation Neurology Clinic.  Dr. Chetkovichs current research focuses on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the targeting of ion channels to synapses and other specialized areas of the dendrites of neurons.  In particular, the lab is interested in the synaptic targeting of ligand and voltage-gated ion channels, molecules responsible for controlling communication in the brain of mammals.  The laboratorys approach utilizes a variety of cellular, molecular and electrophysiological tools to address the mechanisms by which ion channels are targeted to dendrites, as well as the role that this targeting plays in synaptic structure and function as it pertains to epilepsy and brain injury, as well as in disorders of learning and memory such as Autism and Alzheimers disease.  Dr. Chetkovich is also the Director of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP).

1052335	Dr. Farrow's research focuses on the tissue-specific and developmental regulation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the pulmonary vasculature, both in normal transition after birth, as well as in the context of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Dr. Farrows laboratory has demonstrated that exposure to high levels of oxygen, which is a common treatment for both PPHN and BPD, leads to increased PDE5 expression and activity in the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle of neonatal sheep and mice. This increased PDE5 expression and activity leads to decreased pulmonary vascular relaxation in response to nitric oxide, a common pulmonary vasodilator.  In the future, new drugs such as PDE5 inhibitors or anti-oxidants may play an important role in the treatment of infants with PPHN or BPD.
1052350	Dr. Bakers research has focused on access to health care, racial and ethnic disparities in care, health communication, and interventions to improve quality of care for chronic diseases.  In the area of access to care and health care delivery for vulnerable populations, his interests include health literacy, language barriers, the effect of lack of insurance on health care use and health outcomes, and racial and ethnic differences in health care use and outcomes.  He has led studies examining many aspects of quality, including whether hospital mortality report cards lead to changes in market share for hospitals and improvements in outcomes, the effect of disease management programs for patients with heart failure, and the effectiveness of learning collaboratives.  His current work is examining quality measurement and quality improvement using electronic health record systems.
1052350	My research has focused on access to health care, racial and ethnic disparities in care, health communication (including health literacy and language as barriers to care), and quality of care for chronic diseases.  I was Principal Investigator for the Literacy in Health Care Study, the first study of the prevalence of inadequate health literacy, and Principal Investigator for the Prudential Health Literacy Study, the largest study ever conducted of the relationship between literacy, health status, and use of health care services.  I was also the Principal Investigator for a study examining health outcomes for the uninsured among a national sample of adults in late middle-age.  In the area of quality of care, I served as the Associate Project Director for the AHCPR-funded Heart Failure guideline and was lead author for a series of manuscripts in JAMA on quality of care for patients with heart failure. I was Principal Investigator for the largest study conducted to date to determine whether publicly reporting hospital mortality rates led to improvements in outcomes My current projects are examining 1) the relationship between reading comprehension, cognitive function, and mortality among the elderly, 2) methods to improve health communication through multimedia, 3) the relationship between race, ethnicity, and language and quality of care for patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, 4) racial/ethnic differences in subjective versus objective health status (i.e., physical functioning) measures, and 5) use of electronic health records to measure quality of care and to improve healthcare quality and safety.
1052351	My current research efforts employ several innovative methods for quantifying multi-joint upper extremity movement control during both postural and movement tasks in individuals with stroke. I utilize the same quantitative methods to instrument direct impairment-targeted interventions in an effort to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying impaired movement and subsequent restoration of normal movement in individuals with stroke. This research is in collaboration with Julius P.A. Dewald, PT, PhD and is further augmented by collaborations with colleagues with expertise in neural imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. I also specialize in the training of Physical and Occupational Therapists in the administration of impairment, activity, and participation limitation assessments for individuals with stroke and the subsequent processes necessary for standardized delivery of assessments in clinical trials. Through my clinical research efforts I hope to contribute to the evolution of rehabilitation medicine and science by advancing neurological rehabilitation principles and techniques. The key component most likely to impact rehabilitation in this magnitude is the elucidation of the neurological underpinnings responsible for movement discoordination and through the subsequent development of more effective rehabilitation therapies for individuals with functionally debilitating movement impairments.
1052368	Blood Bank   Hemostasis-Coagulation<BR><BR>Our laboratory focuses on the mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant sites in the body, leading to prostate cancer morbidity and death. We have characterized prostate cancer cell lines and found that the ras homolog RhoA and the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB are active and necessary for highly invasive prostate cancer cell behavior. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may promote tumor progression and stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis. We have found that co-cultures with monocyte-derived THP-1 and U-937 cells or peripheral blood monocytes stimulated PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell basement membrane invasion. The monocyte-derived cells also stimulate prostate cancer cell NF-kappaB activity.  Prostate cancer cell invasion and NF-kappaB activity in the co-cultures is inhibited by dominant negative I-kappaBalpha transfection or treatment with biochemical NF-kappaB inhibitors. These studies provide evidence that human monocyte-derived cells cross-communicate with prostate cancer cells and stimulate cancer cell invasion requiring cancer cell NF-kappaB activity. This model has the potential to identify treatments that may target the effect of monocyte-derived cells on cancer cell invasion and progression.  By identifying the mediators of prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis, we hope to discover critical steps of cancer cell invasion and metastasis and find targeted strategies to block malignant prostate cancer progression.

1052813	developmental neurobiologymolecular diagnosticsclinical pathologyResearch Interests <BR> <BR>Our major research interest is understanding the factors that control cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing mammalian central nervous system. Although the mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation during neural development are poorly understood, studies in other tissues suggest that loss of normal cell polarity and tissue architecture play crucial regulatory roles in cell proliferation and cancer. Our most recent work suggests that beta catenin, an integral component of the adherens junction, can regulate cell cycle re-entry and differentiation in the developing mammalian brain. Transgenic mice expressing a truncated, stabilized form of beta catenin develop massively enlarged brains with increased cerebral cortical surface area and folds resembling sulci and gyri of higher mammals. Understanding the biology of epithelial organization can lend insight onto the regulation of proliferation during neural development and ultimately reveal mechanisms underlying developmental brain disorders and tumors in the central nervous system.

1053088	As many as 20% of breast cancer patients have brain metastases, with women surviving only 2-16 months after diagnosis of this metastasis. Thus, resolving the mechanisms of metastasis to the brain is clinically important. In invasive breast carcinomas, Syndecan (Sdc) 1 is observed in stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells where it is involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Staining for Sdc1 in both the tumor and stromal cells has been reported to be a negative predictor of disease free and overall survival in estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast tumors, and expression of Sdc1 and 4 is associated with increased proliferation index in breast tumors. A direct connection between these receptors and breast cancer metastasis has not been shown. The reduced expression of Sdc1 or 4 in MDA-231 breast cancer cells and reduced expression of Sdc4 in CN34Brm breast cancer cells significantly decreased metastases to only the brain but had no effect on bone, lung, or ovarian metastases when the cells were injected into the left ventricle of the mouse heart (nude mice). Additionally, metastases to the brain was reduced when these cells were injected in the orthotopic site of NSG mice, however, primary tumor growth and metastases to the lung, liver, ovaries, and lymph nodes were not affected in this model. These results suggest Sdc1 and 4 facilitate breast cancer organotropism to the brain. We are currently examining the mechanism of how Sdc1 and 4 affects breast cancer organotorpism to the brain. These results may explain the correlative observations of Sdc expression with poor clinical outcome. These studies may lead to development of new biomarkers and/or treatment for breast cancer metastasis to the brain.

1053369	Our research is focused on issues of immune regulation. A long-standing effort has been to understand the how IL-4 is regulated in T and mast cells. We have identified that Ikaros, a transcription factor that regulates chromatin conformation, has distinct cell-type specific effects on the IL-4 gene locus in these cells. We are trying to understand the underlying mechanism of this unique repression of transcription in mast cells and activation of transcription in T cells.Another major project involves the study of mast cells in the autoimmune diseases MS and type 1 diabetes. Althoug well-established mediators of allergic responses, mast cells are potent sources of many immunomodulatory molecules cells that can modulate disease course. Using mast cell-deficient mice, we have established that mast cells are required for fulminant EAE (MS) and NOD mouse diabetes. We are investigating the mechanism of action of these cells in disease pathogenesis.

1054860	The laboratory research of Serdar E. Bulun, MD, focuses on studying estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, in particular aromatase expression, in hormone-dependent human diseases such as breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. A team of investigators works on understanding the epitheial-stromal interactions and aromotase overexpression in breast cancer tissue. Since aromatase inhibitors treat breast tumors primarily via suppressing intratumoral estrogen biosynthesis, these efforts are important for discovering new targets of treatment. Another team studies endometriosis. Basic data from this laboratory led to the introduction of aromatase inhibitors into endometriosis treatment. Human tissues and a primate model are used to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of endometriosis. Regulation of aromatase expression is also studied in uterine fibroids, benign tumors that are dependent on estrogen for growth, by a third team. A fourth team is investigating the link between progesterone action and estrogen inactivation in normal endometrium and endometriosis. Lastly, a fifth team has identified novel mutations that cause familial excessive estrogen formation syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, gynecomastia, and hypogandism in males and early breast development and irregular menses in females. In this syndrome, heterozygous inversions in chromosome 15q21, which cause the coding region of the aromatase gene to lie adjacent to constitutively active cryptic promoters that normally transcribe other genes, result in estrogen excess owing to the overexpression of aromatase in many tissues.

1055047	Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental illness, which affects 1% of the population and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.  We focus our research on the cellular mechanisms by which DISC1, a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, affects neurodevelopment. DISC1 was initially identified in a large Scottish family with members who suffered from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression. DISC1s association with schizophrenia has been confirmed in other population and family studies. Genetic studies have also indicated a DISC1 association with bipolar affective disorder and with autism and Asperger syndrome. Understanding the genetic and developmental basis of schizophrenia is critical for discovering treatments.  Two recent publications by the Morris laboratory focus on the role of Disc1 in development, particularly the migration of cells to their proper location in the brain and subsequent differentiation into their intended fate.
1055048	My lab studies the processes that regulate the early development of the embryo, including cell movements, survival, proliferation, and differentiation.  We focus on a number of proteins which are linked to human birth defects, to try to understand these abnormalities.  In order to observe changes in cells and gene expression, we model human birth defects in both chicken and zebrafish embryos.  This combination of systems allows us to have rapid interrogation of developing embryos as well as large supplies of tissues for comparative studies.  We focus on the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays multiple roles in establishing cell fates, as well as regulating cell numbers by controlling both proliferation and survival.Current studies in my lab include exploring the gene expression changes produced by embryonic exposure to ethanol, and developing novel therapeutics that can restore normal development without causing harm to non-affected embryos.

1055592	My broad research interest lies in understanding the molecular basis of human genetic diseases and developing therapeutics for their treatment. Specifically, my research primarily focuses on neuromuscular diseases, which are those that affect muscle, the nerves that innervate muscle or the neuromuscular junction, which is the connection between the two. One way to approach this problem is to study mutations that disrupt normal neural development. Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a prime example. After cystic fibrosis, SMA is the most common autosomal recessive childhood disease. The disease affects 1/10,000 live born children. It is characterized by degeneration of the a-motor neurons in the spinal cord, which causes proximal, symmetrical limb and trunk muscle weakness that progresses to paralysis and ultimately death. Currently, there is no available treatment for SMA patients. Mutations in survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene are responsible for SMA. In humans, two virtually identical copies of SMN are present, SMN1 and SMN2. SMN1 produces only full-length transcripts (FL-SMN) and is therefore the SMA-determining gene, whereas the predominant transcript from SMN2 is an exon 7 alternatively spliced form. The SMN2 gene also produces a low level of FL-SMN transcript, which explains why SMA is not embryonic lethal in humans. Nevertheless, lower motor neurons eventually succumb to the reduced SMN dosage and degenerate. Why motor neurons are specifically affected is not clear but it has been proposed that this may be due to a distinct role for SMN in this cell type. We have developed a translational research program for SMA. The research is multi-faceted and uses biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, and animal modeling. We use these approaches to decipher SMN function within nerve and muscle, the two tissues affected in SMA. We have also generated a hypomorphic allelic series of Smn mutations in mice that mimic human SMN2 splicing.
1055613	Kinesin motors drive intracellular transport of many different cargoes along microtubules, and they are critical to trafficking in the nervous system as well as cell division.  Antimitotic drugs that act on two kinesin motors, Eg5 and CENP-E, are currently in phase I and II clinical trials.  Several kinesin motors, including Eg5 and CENP-E, are intrinsically regulated in the cell by their C-terminal tail domains. Our laboratory's work is inspired by the fact that there appear to be multiple, highly effective mechanisms that nature has developed for regulating kinesin kinesin motors. Our hope is that once we understand these natural regulation mechanisms, they can be mimicked to develop new and better antimitotic drugs, resulting ultimately in a larger number of treatment options.
1055648	SYNAPTIC STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY: FROM MOLECULES TO COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AND DISEASEResearch in my lab centers on signal transduction networks that regulate the structural and functional plasticity of excitatory synapses. Synaptic communication between neurons within brain circuits underlies cognitive functions, and is disrupted in numerous neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Most central excitatory synapses are located on dendritic spines, and spine structure is essential for normal and pathological brain function. Spine dynamics is crucial for the establishment, maintenance, and experience dependent modification of connectivity in neural circuits. Conversely, abnormal dendritic spine morphology occurs in patients with neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimers disease.As spine morphology is closely associated with cognitive functions, understanding the mechanisms of regulation and dysregulation of spine plasticity is necessary to elucidate the neural bases of cognitive functions and disorders. The long-term goals of my research are:1) to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms that control synaptic structural plasticity. 2) to determine how they influence the development, functioning, and plasticity of brain circuits underlying cognition. 3) to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic pathology and determine their impact on disease endophenotypes. To to achieve these objectives, we employ a multidisciplinary array of molecular, cellular, imaging, transgenic, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches, and have assembled an outstanding team of collaborators.

1056845	My lab is interested in how cell-cell adhesion and differentiation are controlled and coordinated by the multifunctional protein, beta catenin. In particular, we are interested in how the signaling form of beta catenin becomes activated, and how phosphorylation modulates beta catenin's various functions.  Molecular insights into the fine regulation of beta catenin signaling and adhesion will be relevant to pulmonary fibrosis and cancers.
1056845	My research centers on understanding mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion, and how adhesive information is conveyed to the cell's interior.  We focus on the cytoplasmic protein, b-catenin, which plays essential roles in both intercellular adhesion and nuclear signaling.  At the cell surface, b-catenin binds the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin-type adhesion receptors, which allows cells to engage their neighbors through robust intercellular adhering junctions.   In the cytoplasm and nucleus, a cadherin-independent pool of b-catenin transduces extracellular Wnt signals by interacting with TCF-type transcription factors to activate target genes. The Wnt/b-catenin signaling cascade activates genes that allow cells to adopt particular identities throughout development.  In adult tissues, activation of this pathway maintains the 'progenitor' phenotype, while inhibition of this pathway promotes differentiation.  In the lung alveolus, type 2 epithelial cells are thought to give rise to type 1 cells, but the signaling mechanisms which drive this process remain poorly defined.  We reason that modulation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling controls type 2 differentiation into type 1 cells, and experiments are currently underway to address this hypothesis.  Defining the signaling pathways that control AT2 maintenance and differentiation may aid our understanding of the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis and COPD.

1057063	The innovation of pediatric specialty clinicians has extended the lives of children with complex medical needs, neurological impairment, and technology dependence.  However, our systems of care have difficulty meeting the complex needs of this emerging population.  Challenges lie in coordination of care through a vast continuum that includes hospital systems, primary care, home health, etc.  My interests lie in defining this population of patients; studying their needs on a clinical and systems level, and advocating for quality improvement.

1057261	Dr. Podojils work has focused on the role of costimulatory molecule expression and function on both CD4+ T cells and APC populations during autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and he has a particular interest in neuroimmunology.  His primary research focus is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the differential effect of structurally modified forms of anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the CD4+ Th1 cell mediated disease model of PLP139-151-induced EAE. His current findings suggest that stimulation of CD80 on a CD4+ T cell activated in Th1-promoting conditions induces an increase in the amount of IFN-ø produced per cell and increases Th1 cell survival within the CNS.  These findings suggesting a mechanism by which anti-CD80 mAb treatment of PLP139-151-primed mice exacerbates disease, while treatment with anti-CD80 Fab fragments decrease disease severity.  In line with his research studying the role of CD80 expression and reverse signaling to the cell expressing CD80, he has also been studying the role of B7-H4 in CD4+ T cell function.  B7-H4 is a recently discovered B7-family member molecule hypothesized to inhibit effector CD4+ T cell responses.  Since current approaches for regulation of human autoimmune diseases are largely broad-based immunosuppressive strategies necessitating the physical deletion/inhibition of entire subsets of T cells or non-specific inhibition of antigen presentation or pro-inflammatory cytokine production which could compromise the hosts ability to combat opportunistic pathogens and/or increase risk of neoplasia, therefore we are currently investing the ability of short-term therapy with B7-H4 Ig may prove to be clinically viable.

1057699	The focus of research in my laboratory is to understand the immune basis of prostate disease in humans. We have a particular emphasis on chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), a debilitating medical condition characterized by dysuria and pelvic pain.  My laboratory is very interested in understanding the mechanism underlying inflammation of the human prostate and it's impact on prostate diseases. The laboratory utilizes comparative animal models that closely track human prostate disease to examine prostate disease mechanisms and also as tools for translational research. Some specific areas of research interest are as follows -1. Th1/Th17 mechanisms in chronic pelvic pain: We are interested in understanding the mechanism of T cell mediated pain, the effectors of the pain pathway and measures to modulate Th1/Th17 immune response in animal models and ultimately in humans.2. Chemokine mechanisms in chronic pelvic pain:We are in the process of identifying the mechanisms that appear to mediate chemokine mediated pelvic pain by focusing both on the prostate as well as on neuronal mechanisms of central sensitization. A further focus of this project is the role of mast cells and mast cell-released intermediates in the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain. Identification of biomarkers for CP/CPPS in humans is also an emphasis of this project.3. Pattern recognition receptors in prostate inflammation: Deficiencies in TLR4 signaling pathways result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, and profound defects in innate and adaptive immunity. We are  in the process of studying the microbial pathogenesis of prostatic bacterial isolates and dissecting TLR signaling pathways in prostate cells.

1057770	Of the one million hospitalizations for acute heart failure (AHF) that occur every year, 80% are initially managed in the Emergency Department.  Despite tremendous advances in cardiovascular management, these patients have a very high post-discharge mortality and re-hospitalization rate, approaching 35% within 90 days.  The financial costs are also enormous, consuming more than half of the 40 billion spent annually on HF care.  Attempts to improve post-discharge outcomes with novel therapies have all failed, in  spite of 10 years of efforts.  Current therapeutic management in the ED is the same today as 40 years ago.   I firmly believe we can improve these dismal outcomes.   At Northwestern, it has been a tremendous privilege to have mentors/partners/and collaborators who are experts in Cardiology and Medicine both locally, nationally, and internationally to improve the care of AHF patients.  We are actively working to better understand the pathophysiology of early AHF in order to improve post-discharge outcomes for all AHF patients.  Through public/private partnerships, we are actively engaged in the discovery of novel therapies to help patients feel better and live longer.  Through both clinical research as well as quality improvement efforts, we hope to achieve our goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AHF.
1057792	Dr. Rahul Khare has recently received a K08 grant 'Improving Emergency Department (ED) Quality and Safety by Enhancing Operations and Quality Management' from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  For this five-year project Dr. Khare will focus on one key quality indicator score in the ED:  time-to-percutaneous intervention (PCI) quality indicator score for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Patients with STEMI have increased mortality if reperfusion or PCI is not achieved within 90 minutes.   Although there is an extensive literature about implementation of this process, the time-to-PCI quality indicator is achieved only 70% of the time.  Dr. Khare will develop and implement process improvements to address the most serious time-to PCI process concerns and  develop a toolkit, based on the findings that will assist hospitals and EDs in assessing opportunities for operational improvement and offer an approach for assessing and resolving quality management issues for time-to-PCI.

1057897	<BR><BR>Our laboratory is investigating the response of keratinocytes to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. We are investigating the role of JNK, p38 and ERK signal transduction pathways in response of cells to UV light and have recently demonstrated that JNK enzyme co-associates with p53 protein and p21Waf cyclin inhibitor. Other studies in the laboratory focus on development of novel chemopreventive agents against UV-induced skin cancer. Apigenin is a plant flavonoid which has been shown to inhibit UV- and chemically-induced mouse skin tumorigenesis and we believe it shows promise for development as a protective agent against human skin cancer. We have demonstrated that apigenin induces G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes and other cell lines by inhibiting both accumulation of cyclins and the cyclin dependent kinase activities of cdc2p34 and cdk2. We have also demonstrated that apigenin induces expression of the cell cycle inhibitor WAFp21 in a p53-dependent manner, and that the half-life of p53 protein is extended, due to stabilization via site-specific phosphorylation. Experiments are underway to characterize the kinase(s) involved in p53 phosphorylation. Our laboratory is also investigating the mechanisms by which apigenin inhibits UV-induction of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway, an enzyme important for prostaglandin production and cell transformation. Experiments are underway to characterize transcription factors which are involved in UV-induction of COX-2 and which may be modulated by apigenin treatment.

1058111	Our research focuses on fibrosis and tissue repair. Fibrosis and aberrant tissue repair are prominent in autoimmune diseases (scleroderma, myositis, lupus) and in organ-based disorders (pulmonary fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, hypertrophic scar), and are considered intractable. Aberrant tissue regeneration also underlie aging and obesity. Fibrosis contributes to 30% of all death worldwide, and thus represents a compelling and urgent scientific challegen.We believe that fibrosis is in fact potentially reversible. Our research takes a 'systems-biology' multi-disciplinary approach to fibrosis, utilizing human tissue, DNA, serum, and animal models and cell biology studies to identify and validate novel targets for therapy, discover genetic risk factors and useful biomarkers. we then attempt to translate these discoveries into clinically relevant approaches.

PAI-1 level is elevated in different fibrotic tissues and implicated in fibrosis. Paradoxically, PAI-1 deficiency is associated with cardiac fibrosis in aged mice. We are investigating the molecular basis of cardiac fibrosis in PAI-1 deficient mice.

1058962	Research in our laboratory is focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Ca2+ is a ubiquitous intracellular signaling messenger, mediating many essential functions including gene expression, chemotaxis, and neurotransmitter release. Cellular Ca2+ signals generally arise from the opening of Ca2+ permeable ion channels, a diverse family of membrane proteins. We are studying Ca2+ signals arising from the opening of Store-Operated channels (SOCs), a family of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels activated by a decrease in the calcium content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Human patients with mutations in SOCs suffer from a devastating immunodeficiency, underscoring their vital importance for human immunity. We are studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which SOCs are activated and the mechanisms by which they regulate gene expression, immune cell function, and the development of neural stem cells.

He then enrolled as a graduate student at Albany Medical College in Albany, New York, where, under Fred L. Minnear, Ph.D., he studied increased pulmonary vascular permeability associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and explored the possibility of using cAMP-enhancing agents as a possible therapy for the disease.  Dr. Waypa received his M.S., and later his Ph.D., in Physiology and Cell Biology from Albany Medical College in 1997 and 1998, respectively. From 1998 to 2002, Dr. Waypa was a postdoctoral fellow with Paul T. Schumacker, Ph.D. at The University of Chicago.  In 2002, Dr. Waypa received an appointment from The University of Chicago as a Research Associate (Assistant Professor) where he continued to work with Dr. Schumacker.

Currently, Dr. Waypa is studying hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), which is a physiological response to low alveolar oxygen tension and, in cases where a small percentage of the lung alveoli are hypoxic, HPV improves lung gas exchange by redistributing blood flow away from those areas toward regions with better oxygenation.  Key to this research is understanding the mechanism of O2 sensing by the pulmonary vasculature and how this results in the generation of the HPV response.

1059844	Local synaptic circuits in motor-frontal cortex engage in neural operations underlying many aspects of cognition and behavior  motor control, executive functions, working memory, and more  yet circuit organization at the synaptic, cellular, and molecular levels remains poorly understood in this agranular cortex. What is the functional organization of these synaptic pathways? What cellular and circuit-level operations do neurons in these perform? How do these local circuits communicate with each other and how do they interact with subcortical systems in the basal ganglia and thalamus? The focus of our laboratory is to apply multiple tools of quantitative synaptic circuit analysis to elucidate the functional wiring diagrams of neocortical neurons in motor-frontal cortex.

1059913	Synaptic plasticity is the process by which the strength of communication between neurons is modulated in response to stimuli. This process has emerged as the strongest candidate mechanism underlying information storage and processing. In the cerebral cortex, the majority of excitatory synapses found on pyramidal neurons occur on dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are highly dynamic structures and undergo many forms of structural modification. Spine remodelling occurs in concert with changes in post-synaptic function, driven by the trafficking of synaptic glutamate receptors. Thus, structural plasticity is thought to control neural circuit refinement and information storage. Neuromodulators, including dopamine, noradrenaline and neurosteroids, can dramatically influence synaptic plasticity, but much less is known about mechanisms by which these modulators control structural plasticity. Aberrant structural plasticity and neuromodulatory signalling have been extensively associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders and mental retardation. Conversely, increased structural plasticity, and regulation of neuromodulatory signals, can promote functional recovery from neurological disorders. Thus, one of the most important challenges in neuroscience is to uncover the mechanisms underlying structural plasticity during brain development. My work is centered on understanding how neuromodulators and neurosteroids control structural plasticity and the mechanisms that underlie these effects.

1061090	ENDOTHELIAL CELL FUNCTION DURING ALLERGIC DISEASE.Leukocyte migration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation.   Specificity for the site of leukocyte migration is determined by the combination of adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines in the microenvironment. We have focused on the function of the endothelial cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1.  VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelial cells during atherosclerosis, allograft rejection, infection, and asthmatic responses. Furthermore, disruption of the mouse VCAM-1 gene impairs placentation and cardiac development resulting in embryo death.  Thus, VCAM-1 has important functions in development and disease.  As little was known regarding VCAM-1 signaling, we studied the molecular mechanisms for VCAM-1 signal transduction in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.Although it has traditionally been thought that VCAM-1 simply serves as a scaffold for leukocyte binding to endothelium, we have reported that it activates endothelial cell intracellular signal transduction pathways which result in endothelial cell shape changes and leukocyte passage. VCAM-1 activates endothelial cell NADPH oxidase resulting in the generation of low non-toxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  These ROS rapidly stimulate endothelial cell-associated  matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) which are required for VCAM-1-dependent lymphocyte migration. We have also demonstrated that in vivo administration of the antioxidant bilirubin blocks VCAM-1-dependent leukocyte migration into the lung in experimental asthma. Currently, there are two main research directions.  1. We are examining mechanisms for VCAM-1-stimulated activation of endothelial cell NADPH oxidase, including studies of the structure/function of the cytoplasmic tail of VCAM-1.  We are also examining the mechanisms for ROS function in regulating endothelial cell intracellular signals.2.  To further determine whether these VCAM-1 signals function in vivo, we are utilizing knockout and transgenic mouse models to examine VCAM-1-dependent infiltration of eosinophils in experimental asthma.  Pulmonary eosinophilia is one of the most consistent hallmarks of asthma. Information about the mechanisms that control leukocyte infiltration will provide a basis towards proposing interventions in VCAM-1-mediated processes in disease.    Moreover, limiting VCAM-1 dependent inflammation in chronic disease may be an advantageous target as it could spare VCAM-1-independent inflammation such as neutrophil clearance of infections.
1061090	LEUKOCYTE RECRUITMENT DURING ALLERGIC DISEASE. White blood cell (leukocyte) migration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation.   Specificity for the site of leukocyte migration is determined by the combination of adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines in the microenvironment. We have focused on regulation of allergic inflammation by vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1).  VCAM-1 is expressed on blood vessel endothelial cells during atherosclerosis, allograft rejection, infection, and asthmatic responses. Furthermore, disruption of the mouse VCAM-1 gene impairs heart development resulting in embryo death.  Thus, VCAM-1 has important functions in development and disease.  We are examining the molecular mechanisms for VCAM-1 signal transduction in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.  We have reported that VCAM-1 signals through reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide.  These reactive oxygen rapidly stimulate endothelial cell-associated  matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and protein kinase Ca, resulting in endothelial cell contraction for the opening of passageways through which leukocytes migrate.  Blocking this signaling pathway in vivo inhibits allergic inflammation.Currently, there are three main research directions regarding regulation of allergic inflammation. 1. Mechanisms for VCAM-1 signaling.  2. Vitamin E regulation of leukocyte recruitment in allergen responses.3. Amino Acid (5HTP)/Neurotransmitter regulation of inflammation.

1063230	The research of the Economics of Movement group shows that movement and movement learning are similar in many respects. Our Sensors (Eyes, Ears, Skin etc) are not perfect but are noisy. Moreover, our muscles are noisy and if we try to do the same movement over and over it will be different each time. This means that if we make a movement, say swing a golf club, we will have uncertainty in the potential movement outcomes. Our group studies how people make movement decisions in the presence of such uncertainty. Our research has three main thrusts. (1)We study experimentally how people move and how their movements are affected by uncertainty. (2) We build computational models using Bayesian statistics to calculate how people could move optimally or learn to move optimally. (3) We build Bayesian Algorithms to solve problems that we find interesting. For example we analyze how neurons are connected in the nervous system. (4) We use mobile phone and gaming technology to improve rehabilitation and to improve diagnoses.The main thrust of our current research is to allow for better rehabilitation procedures through an understanding of motor learning.

The large obstetric volume at Prentice Women's Hospital allows us to perform large, high-quality studies to answer important questions about pregnancy and delivery care.  We recently completed a large study looking at epistaxis (nose-bleeds) during pregnancy, and found that women with more nose bleeds were more likely to suffer excessive bleeding at delivery. n another project, we examined women with infections during labor (chorioamnionitis) to create a scoring system that allows us to predict which women will become septic. I am also interested in the social and psychological aspects of reproduction and childbearing,and just completed another project looking prospectively at obsessive-compulsive disorder in pregnancy and postpartum, which turns out to be unexpectedly common. I will next be creating a 'Global Assessment of the Postpartum Woman' to get a more comprehensive picture of the mental health challenges women face postpartum.

1063665	Glucocorticoids are the most frequently prescribed medicine today and they are indispensable in the treatment of asthma, inflammation, and cancer.  However, two concerns regarding glucocorticoid use remain unresolved.  One is that high-dose or long-term glucocorticoids result in troublesome side effects such as metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis; the other is that some patients do not respond to glucocorticoids.  We tackle both questions by examining the glucocorticoid receptor.  Translational isoforms of glucocorticoid receptors were recently discovered in our lab and they provide insights into the mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids.  Ribosomal shunting and leaky scanning processes generate translational glucocorticoid receptor isoforms. These receptor isoforms have distinct cell-killing and cytokine-suppression capabilities in a bone cancer cell model system.  Currently, we are identifying and characterizing the receptor isoforms in different populations of immune cells in diseases such as asthma and cancer.This line of research has implications in several other fields in addition to immunology and oncology.  For instance, our findings in glucocorticoid receptor biology have significant impact on research in endocrinology as well.

1063829	My research focuses on the utilization of agent-based modeling for multi-scale modeling of acute inflammation. Agent levels include cells and molecules, with the goal of simulating organ- and organism-level behaviors from these generative mechanisms. While the focus of my models have primarily been on the pathophysiology of sepsis and multiple organ failure, in a more general sense I am interested in using agent-based modeling as a means of dynamic knowledge representation to augment the biomedical research process. With respect to acute inflammation, the ubiquitousness of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms suggest the application of this methodology to such area as oncogenesis, transplant immunology/rejection, autoimmune disease, wound healing/scarring, atherosclerosis and aging. I am currently using NetLogo as my primary agent-based modeling platform, but am involved with the development of SPARK (Simple Platform for Agent-based Representation of Knowledge http://www.pitt.edu/~cirm/spark/ ) currently being done at the University of Pittsburgh. I am also interested in automated text analysis/information extraction from biomedical texts, formal knowledge representation in biomedicine and the development of methods for evolving biomedical ontologies. These goals form a 'front-end' to high-level modeling tools (such as MetaABM http://www.metascapeabm.com/ ) and are intended to facilitate the ability for biomedical knowledge to be represented, communicated and evaluated via executable models. I am also involved in projects directed at developing methods to execute ABMs on massively parallel computing platforms. I believe this is a vital development necessary for true, multi-scale, biologically relevant simulation.

1064467	My main clinical interest is the diagnosis and treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases and my research interest is focused on elucidating the pathogenesis of primary immune deficiency diseases, understanding the natural history of these diseases and developing novel approaches to their therapy. Lymphocyte development is another area of interest, which ties in closely with primary immunodeficiency disease as many of these diseases results from failure of lymphocyte development.  In addition, I am also interested in the immunopathogenesis of allergic diseases especially food allergy and the mechanisms involved in the development of tolerance to allergens.
1064580	The main focus of my research program is to study roles of tumor suppressors in normal development and in breast and prostate cancer progression, focusing on Maspin and an Ets transcription factor PDEF. Maspin is a unique member of SERPIN family that plays roles in normal tissue development, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis. Genetic studies by my laboratory using maspin transgenic and knockout mice demonstrated an important role of maspin in normal mammary, prostate, and embryonic development. Recently, we have identified several new properties of maspin. As a protein that is present on cell surface, maspin controls cell-ECM adhesion. This function is responsible for maspin-mediated suppression of tumor cell motility and invasion. We have also discovered that maspin is involved in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis through a mitochondrial death pathway. The long-term goals of these projects are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which maspin and PDEF control tumor metastasis and to identify their physiological functions in development. Another focus of research in Zhang lab is to identify immune components that control breast cancer metastasis. Chronic inflammation not only increases neoplastic transformation but also drives the inhibition of the immune response in a protective negative-feedback mechanism. Suppressive immune cells are recruited to the sites of inflammation and function to inhibit both innate and adaptive immune responses, enabling tumor tolerance and unmitigated tumor progression. To study the interplay between tumor and immune cells, Zhang lab has developed a unique animal model of breast cancer that reproduces different stages of breast cancer bone metastasis. Molecules that control tumor-immune cell interaction and immunosuppression have been identified. We are currently studying roles of these genes in tumor-driven evolution that control chronic inflammation and immunosuppression.

Dr. Hous graduate training includes a Master of Medical Science degree in epidemiology and community medicine and a MD & PhD combined degree in molecular genetics in Japan. Dr. Hou further received her postdoctoral training in molecular cancer epidemiology in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  With a multidisciplinary background in medicine, basic science, and epidemiology, Dr. Hous research interest lies in integrating traditional epidemiologic methods with the ever-advancing molecular techniques in multi-disciplinary research focusing on identifying key molecular markers and understanding their potential impact on disease etiology, detection, and prevention.  Dr. Hous major research efforts to date have focused on two areas: 1) identification of risk factors that may cause chronic diseases; and 2) identification of biomarkers that serve as indicators of an individuals past exposure to disease risk factors and/or predict future disease risks and/or prognosis. The environmental/lifestyle risk factors that Dr. Hou has studied include air pollution, pesticides, overweight, physical inactivity, and reproductive factors in relation to chronic diseases.  The biomarkers that Dr. Hou has investigated include genetic factors (i.e., polymorphisms, telomere length shortening, mitochondria DNA copy number variations); and epigenetic factors (i.e., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA profiling).  Her over-arching research goal is to understand the biological mechanisms linking environmental risk factors with subclinical or clinical disease development, which ultimately lead to development of effective strategies for prevention of chronic diseases.
1064657	1. Mechanisms and physiology of Interleukin-10 mediated attenuation of cardiovascular injury and inflammation. These studies have an overall focus to understand the role of inflammation in exacerbating post-injury myocardial functions and tissue repair. The strategy involves utilizing IL-10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Past studies delineated the mechanisms by which IL-10 imparts its inhibitory action and showed that on molecular level, IL-10 acts mainly via post-transcriptional de-stabilization of mRNA half-life by suppressing mRNA stabilizing protein HuR which binds to mRNAs harboring specific A+U rich sequences in their 3 untranslated regions.  Current studies are expanded utilize IL-10 and its direct downstream target HuR, as potential therapeutic approaches to inhibit inflammation in post-myocardial infarction in animal models and to elucidate signaling pathways that govern IL-10 actions both in vitro and in vivo (Rajasingh et al, FASEB J, 2006; Krishnamurthy et al, Circ Res., 2009, Krishnamurthy et al., FASEB J, 2010). 2. Epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells to generate induced pluripotent cells and mechanisms of embryonic stem cell differentiation into cardiovascular linage cells. One component of this research focuses on to understand the molecular and signaling mechanisms governing directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (Rajasingh J et al, Circ. Res., 2007).  The second project in regenerative and stem cell biology that we have developed is to epigenetically reprogram adult somatic cells into ES-like cells (iPS cells) by utilizing cell-free ES cell protein extracts thereby bypassing the use of retroviral mediated forced expression of exogeneous transgenes (Rajasingh J et al, Circ Res., 2008). Studies are ongoing to address the mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming and to define the role of critical epigenetic factors required for this transition.
1064657	CURRENT RESEARCH INTERESTS1 )  To understand molecular mechanisms and signal transduction involved in the inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha)-induced dysfunction of endothelial cells (EC) in cell culture model system and the mechanisms of cytokine regulation on the healing of endothelium in vivo in moue models of carotid artery denudation (equivalent to balloon angioplasty in patients). We have established that locally secreted TNF acts to inhibit endothelial recovery leading to restenosis, partly via inducing cell cycle arrest in ECs (Kishore, Circulation Research 2002, 2003; JCI, 2005),although complete molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways involved therein are yet to be deciphered. Understanding of EC gene regulation may potentially help finding target molecules whose modulation can nullify deleterious effects of TNF. Another component of this project involves elucidating trans-factors involved in posttranscriptional (mRNA stability) regulation of TNF by anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Rajasingh, Kishore, FASEB J, 2006).2)  To understand the molecular and signaling mechanisms governing directed differentiation of mouse embryonic (Rajasingh, Circulation Research; 2007) and adult stem cells and oocyte-independent means for the de-differentiation of adult somatic cells to generate stem-like cells and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of these cells towards tissue repair in mouse models of surgically induced myocardial infarction and other ischemic injuries.3) To study and understand the role of long-term alcohol consumption (chronic alcoholism) on cardiovascular system. Chronic ethanol inhibits cell survival signaling by various mechanisms, including but not limited to the enhanced release of TNF and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our studies indicate that in vitro chronic ethanol exposure exerts inhibitory effects on EC proliferation and survival (Luedemann, Kishore, Alco Clin Exp Res, 2005; Rajasingh, Kishore, Endocrinology, 2007). Chronic ethanol not only elevates agonist-induced TNF expression in EC but also exacerbates TNF-mediated EC dysfunction, synergistically. Our current studies are focused toward understanding the biology of ethanol-induced EC dysfunction in ethanol-fed rodent models as wells as towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms in cell culture model system.

1066072	1.Patients with diabetes and obesity have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. These metabolic conditions are associated with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance leading to severe coronary events and worse clinical outcomes. The long-term goal of our research is to determine mechanisms by which diabetes/obesity increase risk for coronary artery disease and the resulting pathophysiological consequences. In this context, macrophages (part of the innate immune system) have emerged as a key pathogenic link between diabetes/obesity and the resulting coronary artery disease. Macrophages play critical role in regulating the body's inflammatory response to environmental stimuli, pathogen recognition, clearing cellular debris and inflammatory cytokine secretion. However, their chronic activation in diabetes/obesity might induce endothelial dysfunction, cardiac cell death, extracellular matrix remodeling and contractile dysfunction leading to heart failure. Our research efforts are focused on understanding the cellular and molecular connections between macrophage biology, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance, and diabetes/obesity-induced cardiovascular disease. These studies will facilitate development of novel therapies that specifically target recruited macrophages to treat the underlying inflammation and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes/obesity.2. Acute ischemic injury and chronic cardiomyopathies lead to permanent loss of cardiac tissue. Transplantation of bonemarrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells has the potential to improve cardiac function after ischemic injury. However, number and functional capacity of these cells are impaired in diabetes. Our objectives are to determine the impact of the diabetic milieu (high glucose and fatty acids) on progenitor cell biology and function and their contribution to myocardial repair in response to ischemic injury.
1066075	My research for the past 20 years has been in the areas of immune responsiveness and tolerance induction in clinical organ transplantation.  These studies have resulted in more than 200 publications including book chapters, review articles and editorials, original papers and presentations.  The major thrust of these has been on the immunological effects of donor bone marrow cell (DBMC) and donor hematopoetic stem cell (DHSC) infusions in organ transplant patients using in vitro and ex vivo culture systems. It has been observed that using multiple assays for donor specific unresponsiveness may identify potentially tolerant recipients who may be candidates for immunosuppressive drug (IS) withdrawal. Recent studies have also assessed the role of CD4+CD25High FoxP3+ regulatory T cells as potential tolerance inducers in kidney and liver transplant patients, as well as the differential susceptibility these cells to various immunosuppressive drugs used in clinical transplantation.

1066664	Primary research interests are in the applications of minimally invasive surgery to spine.  Secondary research interest is in stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury.
1066665	My laboratory explores the cell surface as a dynamic platform regulating cell behavior.  Specifically, we seek to understand how surface glycoproteins regulate cell-cell fusion in muscle cells, and to determine how pathogens target cardiac muscle.  Using surface modification, we then hope to re-engineer stem cells to improve tissue targeting and tissue integration.  To accomplish these broad aims, our current research projects are exploring the following research issues:  (1) Tissue tropism of Trypanosoma cruzi.  T. cruzi demonstrates tissue tropism during both the acute and chronic phases of infection, targeting cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle.  Patients with chronic T. cruzi infection may develop clinical symptoms related to target tissue infection, notably myositis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and megasyndromes.  The molecular basis for these clinical observations is incompletely understood.  My research hopes to define and characterize the cell surface proteins important during the initial host-parasite interaction enabling myogenic specificity.  (2) Drug discovery for African Trypanosomiasis. T. brucei behaves as an eukaryotic tumor in the host. We are exploring the use of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, as well as targeting bioactive lipid pathways, to discover potential inhibitors. (3) Cell-cell fusion and GPI-anchored proteins during skeletal myogenesis.  Secondary skeletal myogenesis, the process of differentiation of dividing, mononuclear myoblast into quiescent, multinucleate myotubes is critical for maintenance of skeletal muscle during aging and after injury.  GPI-anchored cell surface proteins appear to be critical for these regulated membrane-membrane fusion events.  Our research hopes to dissect the molecular choreography occurring at the site of opposing membranes which enables cell fusion.

1067182	Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are two bacterial pathogens that are very closely related, yet cause vastly different diseases in the mammalian host. Y. pestis is infamous for causing the devastating disease plague, while Y. pseudotuberculosis infection often results in a mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal illness. While genetically similar, the distinct mechanisms by which these two bacterial species interact with the host is of great interest to our group.Shared amongst both pathogens is a protein called Hfq, which serves as a chaperone for small, non-coding regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). One set of projects in the lab centers on understanding the post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by Hfq and sRNAs in both Yersinia species, particularly as they relate to virulence. We anticipate that the similarities and differences we identify between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis in this regard will provide keen insight into how a relatively mild pathogen evolved into one of the most deadly known to mankind.We are also interested in determining the mechanisms by which Y. pestis specifically causes primary pneumonic plague, a respiratory form of disease that Y. pseudotuberculosis does not produce. Another set of projects in the lab focuses on dissecting the mechanisms by which the Y. pestis virulence factor Pla controls the development of pneumonic plague. These include understanding the interaction of Y. pestis and Pla with the mammalian fibrinolytic and coagulation cascades, the identification of additional host substrates cleaved by Pla that lead to the development of a severe pneumonia, and the mechanisms by which Pla specifically induces an overwhelming inflammatory response in the lungs during infection.

1067418	Our lab is interested in studying signaling pathways that regulate cancer progression. One of our current projects looks at the role of the extracellular matrix protein, collagen, a major component of the fibrosis associated with pancreatic cancer, in promoting chemotherapy resistance. We have recently found that collagen up regulates expression of the matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (MMP14), which in turn induces expression of the chromatin modeling protein HMGA2. This results in pancreatic cancer cells escaping the proliferation arrest on gemcitabine treatment.

1068720	The overarching goal of our research is to improve upon current methods of bone healing.  In particular, we hope to develop more efficient and cost-effective methods of spine fusion that are associated with fewer adverse effects.  We utilize several different approaches to accomplish these goals.One research arm involves the use of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from human adipose tissue to elicit spine fusion in a point-of-care protocol.  In this research, we isolate mesenchymal stem cells from human liposuction aspirates and evaluate their capacityin conjunction with both standard and novel, nanotechnology-based carriersto elicit bone formation.  A second arm of our research utilizes a novel nanotechnology developed by our collaborator, Dr. Samuel Stupp, Director of the NU Institute for Bionanotechnology in Medicine (IBNAM).  Here, we employ a self-assembling, biodegradable nanogel composed of cylindrical nanofibers which contain an epitope directed at bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) in an attempt to facilitate spine fusion in our rat posterolateral spinal arthrodesis model.  Our research also focuses more broadly on mechanisms of bone healing.  In these studies, we investigate the molecular pathways by which normal bone healing occurs, as well as mechanisms by which these processes are disrupted, such as under osteoporotic conditions and after exposure to smoke and other environmental contaminants. Our goals are to elucidate these mechanisms of bone healing inhibition and develop novel methods to prevent such effects.
1068930	Cilia Polarity.The ability of ciliated epithelia to generate directed fluid flow is an important aspect of diverse developmental and physiological processes including proper respiratory function.  To achieve directed flow, ciliated cells must generate 100-200 cilia that are polarized along a common axis both within and between cells.  My lab is currently working towards understanding the molecular mechanisms for how cell polarity is coordinated as well as how individual cilia interpret the cells polarity.  Centriole Duplication.Centrioles are microtubule based structures with nine fold symmetry that are involved in both centrosome organization and aster formation during cell division.  During the normal cell cycle centrioles duplicate once, generating a mother / daughter pair, and in most post-mitotic vertebrate cells the mother centriole then goes on to form the basal body of a sensory cilium.  Abnormalities in the duplication of centrioles (and centrosomes) are prevalent in many cancers suggesting a link between centriole duplication and cancer progression.  My laboratory is addressing this fundamental question in cell biology from a novel direction with the use of Xenopus motile ciliated cells.  Ciliated cells are unique among vertebrate cells in that they naturally generate hundreds of centrioles therefore providing a great system for studying the regulation of centriole duplication.  Understanding how nature has overcome the typically tight regulation of centriole duplication will lend insight into the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression.

1069043	My research is to understand molecular mechanisms that govern the biological functions of the intracellular signaling network in both physiological and pathological events.  We focus on regulation of JNK, which is member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily.  JNK is activated by a MAP kinase module through sequential protein phosphorylation in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including proto-oncogens, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and physical stresses.  Once activated, JNK phosphorylates its cytoplasmic target proteins such as members of the Bcl-2 family proteins, Itch, tau, IRS-1, or its nuclear target proteins such as the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF2, Elk-1, Stat3 and p53, thereby controlling proliferation, differentiation, programmed death and transformation.  Not surprisingly, JNK is involved in the process of many human diseases including lung diseases and lung cancer.   Through its involvement in regulation of airway smooth muscle cell proliferation, cell death, myofibroblasts proliferation, cytokine synthesis and transformation, JNK is likely to play a critical role in asthma, ischemia/reperfusion damage, pulmonary fibrosis, allergic inflammation in lung and NSCLC.  However, the challenge is how to selectively modulate JNK activity in vivo.  We have evidence that JNK functions as a protein complex, i.e., the JNK signalsome that is composed of both known JNK activators and novel stimulus-dependent modulators or regulators (SMOR).  SMORs are selectively recruited to or dissociated from the JNK signalsome in a stimulus-dependent manner, thereby specifying the activation of JNK by various extracellular stimuli.  It is possible that one can target a unique SMOR to selectively regulate JNK activation by a specific stimulus without affecting JNK activation by other stimuli or affecting activation of other singling pathways by that stimulus.  Our study on the JNK signalsome should shed light on our understanding of the molecular mechanism of pulmonary diseases including lung cancer and provide potential therapeutic targets.

Outside of the United States, advanced retinoblastoma is an even greater clinical challenge in developing countries, where the mortality rate among children diagnosed with advanced metastatic retinoblastoma is as high as 80%.    Our laboratory mission is to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with retinoblastoma progression in order to facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets.  We are accomplishing our mission by studying both genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during retinoblastoma progression in human retinoblastoma tumors, and in retinoblastoma model systems.  Defining these changes is particularly valuable for the purposes of identifying novel targets for chemotherapeutic interventions.

1069212	Stem cell dysfunction likely plays a central role in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases, particularly aging and cancer.  The use of simple eukaryotic model organisms in aging research has led to the identification and characterization of many genetic and environmental factors that modulate longevity.  The classic invertebrate model organisms, such as nematodes and fruit flies , however, are not ideal models for investigating the role of stem cells in human disease because of the relative absence of adult stem cells in these species.  My research program combines interests from my graduate research (stem cell biology) and postdoctoral work (basic biology of aging) using the freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, as a model system. Our goal is to establish S. mediterranea as a model for the study of aging and age-related disease, with emphasis on the role of stem cells in longevity. S. mediterranea represents an excellent model for investigating mechanisms of longevity because of their apparent immortality and remarkable capacity to repair and regenerate tissues .  Regeneration in planarians is due to the presence of neoblasts, a pluripotent stem cell population in the adult.   To investigate the relationship between stem cells and longevity, we are using known longevity determinants to characterize age-related phenotypes in planaria, paying particular attention to regeneration and tissue homeostasis. We are also investigating telomere homeostasis and it's role in stem cell function in planaria.  Together, these efforts will establish S. mediterranea as a powerful model for the study of aging and age-related disease, and bring new understanding into the role of stem cells in longevity.

1069886	One of the focuses of my laboratory is to elucidate inflammatory signals induced in mucosal innate and T cells by bacterial products (e.g., peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, surface layer proteins) leading to intestinal colitis. Using gene targeting in probiotic bacteria we clearly show the mitigation of colitis progression. Additionally, to mobilize mucosal and systemic immunity against microbial challenge we further optimize various aspects of our mucosal multivalent-vaccine platform against a broad range of pathogens such as HIV, H1-N1, and Biodefense. This goal is achieved by directly targeting immunogens to small peptides derived from a phage display peptide library leading to efficiently capture by dendritic cells when expressed by probiotic bacteria at the mucosal side.

1071859	Parkinson's disease results from the degeneration and frank loss of dopamine-releasing neurons in the substantia nigra. Interestingly, a nearby population of dopamine-releasing neurons in the ventral tegmental area remains unaffected by this degenerative process.  Recent studies have suggested that this degenerative process, and the onset of Parkinson's disease, are preceded by a similar process that takes place in other brain regions, wherein only a particular class of neurons is affected while others are spared.I am interested in understanding whether there is a common mechanism underlying the selective nature of these neurodegenerative processes. A hypothesis put forward by Dr. D. James Surmeier points to a common property shared by the various neurons that degenerate. They are all perpetually active neurons whose output is necessary for basic physiological functions carried out by such systems as the cardiovascular system or the gastrointestinal tract. According to this hypothesis the ongoing activity of these cells comes at a metabolic cost leading to their premature 'aging' and death.In particular I am studying the machinery that enables neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, that innervate the heart and the GI tract, to maintain their perpetual activity, and how this may cause them to be particularly vulnerable to neurodegeneration. My research combines neurophysiological techniques, live cell imaging, molecular biological tools and computational modeling.Additional interests:1. the cellular basis for the role played by cholinergic interneurons of the striatum, in health where their activity comprises a neural correlate of classical conditioning, and in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease where their release of acetylcholine is upregulated.2. The biophysics underlying collective dynamics of perpetually active neurons.3. Design and development of electrodes for functional electrostimulation.4. Deep brain stimulation.

1072154	My lab focuses on how genetic and epigenetic modulators promote the development and maintenance of adult stem cells. Microenvironments, or niches, support the maintenance of stem cells and facilitate the development of tumors through largely unknown mechanisms. Cell-autonomous genetic pathways and epigenetic networks have emerged as important determinants for the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells in embryonic, juvenile, and adult issues. The importance of non-cell autonomous genetic and epigenetic factors is less well established. Our goal is to identify and characterize the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms utilized by both stem cells and their surrounding niche in supporting the stem cell program. For these studies, the developing mouse testis is used to examine interactions between male germline stem cells (GSCs) and their somatic niche.

1072968	The goal of my research is to understand the molecular basis by which animals and their natural microbiota form specific, reproducible interactions. Microbial symbioses are prevalent in animal biology, and often, as in the case of humans, the animal host is born devoid of its natural symbionts and must acquire microbial partners from the environment. Pathogenic and beneficial bacteria share common mechanisms by which they colonize animal tissue. In spite of these parallels, relatively little work has been accorded to the beneficial associations, which are widespread, and critical to the lifecycles of both the bacterial and animal partners. I am studying the natural association between Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid to understand the processes that underlie host colonization in animal-associated bacteria. The system is particularly amenable to studying microbe-host interactions because V. fischeri is the only bacterial resident of the squid's light organ, and we seek to understand how V. fischeri specifically colonizes the host to the exclusion of other species. Each generation, the squid hatch without their microbial partners and must selectively recruit V. fischeri from the ocean. We use a combination of bacterial genetics and imaging to identify how the animal and bacteria communicate to reproducibly establish this productive relationship.

1080111	Research Interests:Our laboratory concentrates its efforts into the investigation of the mechanistic connection between aging, cellular and/or mitochondrial metabolism, and carcinogenesis focusing on the Sirtuin gene family. To address this idea, over the past five years, we have constructed mice that have the three primary (Sirt1-3) sirtuins genetically deleted.  The mice that lack Sirt1 (Wang et al., 2009, Cancer Cell), Sirt2 (Kim et al., 2011, Cancer Cell), and Sirt3 (Kim et al., 2010, Cancer Cell) each develop breast cancer, as well as other types of malignancies to varying degrees, and the levels of SIRT1-3 are also decreased in human cancer samples, as compared to normal tissues.  In addition, the mechanism connecting the tumor permissive phenotype and the aberrant regulation of mitochondrial ROS, at least in part, in the Sirt3 knockout mouse has recently been published (Tao et al., 2010, Molecular Cell).  Thus, based on these results it seems clear that the primary sirtuin deacetylase proteins are tumor suppressor in several breast cancers as well as to a lesser extent in several other human malignancies.  These results seemed logical, since human sirtuins are the human homologs for the yeast and C. elegans longevity genes, and breast cancers have one of the strongest correlations to age.  Thus, it is proposed that the primary sirtuin family knockout mice may present a novel group of models to establish, validate, and investigate the well established connection between aging, metabolism, and cancer.  These murine models are also used to pursue the laboratories interest and the identification and validation of chemopreventative agents and we currently have a DOD and R01 grants to pursue this for luminal B breast malignancies.  Finally, the laboratory has a series of murine in vivo and in vitro models to mechanistically connect Sirt2 and Sirt3 to cancers of the breast, pancreas, liver, and lung that are currently be used.

2206725	Prolactin and Breast Cancer<BR><BR>The research focus in Dr. Clevengers lab is the characterization of prolactin (PRL) receptor signal transduction and function as it relates to breast cancer and mammary gland development. The PRL receptor (PRLr) is a member of the growth factor/cytokine receptor family, which includes the receptors for interleukin 2-7, GM-CSF, EPO, and GH. Within humans, PRL functions at the endocrine and autocrine/paracrine levels as a growth, differentiation, and motility factor within the breast, a hypothesis first postulated by our laboratory. Therefore, one of our major aims is the characterization of those mechanisms that regulate PRL/PRLr expression and action in both normal and neoplastic tissues. PRL action in human tissues is mediated by the PRLr. The molecular dissection of PRLr isoform structure/function is a research focus, utilizing both biochemical and biophysical approaches to examine PRL-PRLr binding and the interaction of the PRLr with its associated transduction pathways that include JAK/Stat, Nek3/Vav2/Rac, Fyn, SIRPa, NFAT, and c-myb. We have also recently identified a direct genomic action of PRL on gene expression. This action is mediated by the prolyl isomerase cyclophilin B (CypB), which retrotransports endocytosed ligand into the nucleus, where the PRL/CypB complex directly interacts with and activates the Stat5 transcription factor. Additional research by our lab on prolyl isomerases has found that cyclophilin A (CypA) is required for proximal PRLr transduction, functioning as the molecular switch facilitating ligand-induced conformational change of the PRLr enabling Jak2 activation. As such our findings present vantage points in the development of novel therapies aimed at modulating PRL action during the differentiation of the human breast and the pathogenesis of malignancy in this tissue.

In particular, my research is currently focused on developing more effective interventions for increasing physical activity, eating healthier, and for weight management in general.  One common feature of my research involves differentiating autonomous and controlled forms of motivation based on a self-determination theory framework. And I am especially interested in interventions that support a subset of autonomous motivation known as intrinsic motivation, a subcategory characterized by interest and enjoyment. My research program is currently exploring ways to leverage technology (e.g., smartphone apps & accelerometry), game design, social networks, choice, and financial incentives in ways that support autonomous motivation and lasting behavior change.  An underlying principle is that, if we can help people to value or even enjoy healthy behaviors, healthy changes will tend to come more easily and be more easily maintained.Another complimentary feature of this research program involves my orientation toward collaboration and crossdisciplinary team science.  Compelling empirical evidence suggests that, when done well, team science is more creative, more impactful, and more fun; and Ive found support for these principles in my experience, as well. You can find more information and training tools for crossdisciplinary researchers at TeamScience.net, a website co-developed with Drs. Spring, Falk-Krzesinski, and the team at NogginLabs, Inc.
2245338	My research falls under the broad umbrella of aging and dementia and uses a multimodal approach to investigate two aging perspectives: primary progressive aphasia (PPA) in which neurodegenerative disease invades the language network and SuperAging in which individuals are seemingly resistant to the deleterious changes in memory associated with normal or more typical cognitive aging. My investigations have provided new fundamental knowledge with translational implications for cognitive aging, dementia, and neurodegenerative disease as well as the cognitive neuroscience of language and memory. Since joining the faculty at the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimers disease Center (CNADC) at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in 2008, I have led the neuroimaging arm of our NIDCD funded Language in PPA R01 project and the cognitive and neuroimaging arm of the SuperAging study. While structural neuroimaging is my primary method of investigation it is not the only tool I use. My other investigations have explored the role of genetic, developmental and acquired factors in aging and dementia, which demonstrates my capacity to collect and integrate multidisciplinary data. I have a successful history of funding and recently received R01 funding from the NINDS to examine the relationship between clinical decline, brain atrophy and putative underlying pathology using PET amyloid imaging.
2247422	Dr. Matic's research in therapeutic biomedical optics has involved lasers for skin incisions, low-level irradiation of periodontal bacteria and, most recently, optical stimulation of the cochlea.  She is a leading expert in the field of pulsed infrared neural stimulation (INS) and is currently studying INS in the auditory system to improve cochlear implants.  Currently, the function of cochlear implants is limited, in part, by the spread of electric current in the cochlea and, therefore, the restored hearing and speech perception to cochlear implant users is less than ideal.  Lasers can stimulate smaller populations of neurons than conventional electrical stimulation, likely improving the users' speech perception.  We are working towards a novel cochlear implant built on optical technology.  Dr. Matic is also interested in further therapeutic uses of biomedical optics in otolaryngology, and other intersections of optics and neurophysiology/neural engineering.  Dr. Matic received her B.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Vanderbilt University and her M.S. and Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Northwestern University.

EMPLOYEE_ID	DESCRIPTION3
1000176	Clinical:  Analytical flow cytometry.  I am the Medical Director of Flow Cytometry Laboratory at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  <br><br> Research:  Investigation of the basic cell biology of B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the major research interest of the laboratory. B-CLL is characterized by malignant cells having an anti-apoptotic phenotype and the accumulation of malignant cells is thought to be primarily driven by a block in apoptosis. However, when B-CLL cells are placed in in vitro culture, rapid apoptosis occurs raising the question of whether there are inherent defects in the apoptotic regulatory machinery or whether the dysregualtion seen is due to paracrine and/or autocrine factors. We are currently investigating potential paracrine/autocrine loops regulating apoptosis in the malignant B cell population. Specifically, the potential role of altered cytokine production by tumor specific oligoclonal T cells in these patients and its relationship to apoptosis control in the malignant B cells is being studied.     Although proliferation centers are seen in B-CLL, an additional abnormality is dysregulation of proliferation control in the malignant B cells with few proliferating cells seen in vivo and a lack of proliferative response to a number of normal B cell mitogens. In fact, although non-proliferative, the B cells in B-CLL patients may not be blocked in G0 but rather at a later point in the cell cycle. The other major area of investigation in the laboratory is elucidation of the mechanisms of proliferation dysregulation in these patients.     The laboratory is also involved in development of a number of complex multiparametric flow cytometry based clinical analyses both for diagnostic purposes and for patient specific therapeutic decision/monitoring purposes including assessment of signal transduction pathways in the setting of kinase inhibtor therapies.
1000184	Autopsy pathology, Cardiac pathology <BR><BR> Lipids are important regulators of the activity of many proteins including those involved in cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and neural regulation, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms mediating these effects. My laboratory staff members are engaged in a program of basic research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which lipids act as specific ligands to regulate cellular responses, and to investigate in select areas of cardiovascular disease how aberrations of signaling pathways may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of human disease. We have used the family of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C isoforms as a model to study protein-lipid interactions. Upon stimulation by various hormones these membrane associated enzymes hydrolyze polyphosphoinositides to yield second messengers such diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The determinants of enzyme function are complex and can be broken down into several primary components: substrate binding and catalysis, enzyme translocation, and regulation. During the past several years we have identified the structural motifs in the PLC delta 1 isoform that mediate each of the three primary functions. All three motifs require the binding of a specific lipid for function. The structural motif mediating translocation also modulates the rate catalysis, and is encoded by a unique domain termed the pleckstrin homology or PH domain. This newly discovered protein module of 100 amino acids exists in many molecules (including PLC d1) that participate in signal transduction. Our research is among the first to demonstrate a clear function in signal transduction for the PH domain, and serves a paradigm for the activation and regulation of many signaling molecules.

The ability to use language can be progressively disrupted by neurodegenerative diseases of the brain that target circumscribed regions that normally mediate language in healthy individuals.  My clinical and research interests focus on Individuals with Primary Progressive Aphasia, Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.  Research projects address the neuropsychological, neuroimaging and neuropathological variables associated with these syndromes, in order to contribute to our understanding of risk and the genetic factors that determine regional brain vulnerability to these diseases and to identify biomarkers that can be used in diagnosis during the patient's lifetime.  To date, there are no biomarkers that definitively predict the type of the neuropathology in these clinical syndromes in the individual patient.  Additional interests in the area of brain aging and its effects on cognition lie in determining factors associated with 'Superaging', the maintenance of a high level of cognitive ability into the 9th decade of life and beyond.

1001887	We have established that in systemic lupus (SLE), the immune system responds abnormally to nucleosomes, the major products of body's own cells undergoing apoptosis (J. Exp. Med. 177:1367, 1993). Our main research programs involve studies on the origins of autoimmune response to nucleosomes, and signaling defects in autoimmune T and B cells that lead to abnormal co-stimulation and apoptosis-resistance. Work is progressing in parallel in lupus patients and mouse models of lupus we developed (Nature 263:412, 1976).  We have identified nucleosomal peptide epitopes critical for cognate interactions between the autoimmune T helper (Th) cells and anti-DNA B cells in murine and human lupus (J. Exp. Med. 183:2459, 1996). Recognition of these autoepitopes by lupus T cell receptors (TCR) is highly promiscuous which makes the peptides extremely potent for therapy of established lupus autoimmunity by a mechanism we call 'tolerance spreading'. We have also developed transgenic mice, bearing nucleosome-specific TCR genes, to determine how the autoimmune T cells escape censorship in the thymus despite exposure to apoptosis products, and how they could be regulated in the periphery.  Moreover, we found that the Th and B cells of lupus have defects that lower their threshold for costimulatory signaling and make them resistant to anergy induction. These defects lead to sustained production of pathogenic autoantibodies. We are studying new pathways for resistance to anergy and activation induced death in autoimmune T cells of lupus, as revealed by differential gene expression profiling. 
1001926	I am interesting in medical education in the field of radiology at multiple levels, as well as overall health care policy and quality. Radiation exposure for medical imaging is becoming a big quality and safety issue. Within the field of radiology I am most interesed in ultrasound.  
1001944	My current research interests lie in 1) understanding the relationship between community factors and clinical ones, particularly related to childhood obesity; 2) early origins of childhood obesity; 3) means to intervene to reduce obesity and its co-morbidities in young children; 4) the effects of community based interventions on obesity prevalence and health behaviors.
1001981	We are primarily conducting translational research, some of which is in conjunction with a colleague in anthropology, Dr. Gillian Bentley.  We have studied hormone differences between populations of women in the developing countries of Bolivia and Bangladesh and the Western countries, US and UK.  Salivary progesterone concentrations are significantly lower in women of developing countries, and migrant studies show that the age of the migrants is critical in the adaptation of the Western hormone patterns.  Adult migrants do not adapt to the higher progesterone levels.  Salivary estradiol is not significantly different between these population groups.  We are interested in the relation of hormone levels to fertility and to breast cancer incidence.  Other studies involve Dr. Seema Khan, Department of Surgery.  We are studying hormone and products of hormone action in nipple aspirate fluid and breast random fine-needle aspirates from women with different levels of breast cancer risk to ascertain the associations of hormones with the potential for breast cancer development.  The very small samples obtained make the procedure more acceptable than other biopsy procedures but the amount of biomarkers in the samples are limiting.  For this purpose we are working with Dr. Chad Mirkin and others in the Nanotechnology Program to develop assays with several-fold greater sensitivities than the current immunoassays.  We are also funded to study the potential for transdermal application of the biologically active metabolite of tamoxifen to the breast as an alternative to oral administration of tamoxifen.  We are working with Dr. Dean Ho of the Bioengineering Faculty to develop more efficient delivery systems for this application.  Potentially, this will eliminate some of the undesirable side-effects of tamoxifen that cause a majority of women to reject the prophylactic use of tamoxifen.

1002030	Dr. Mala Shanmugams research focuses on targeting abnormal glucose metabolism in the hematologic malignancies: multiple myeloma, CLL and mantle cell lymphoma. Elevated glucose consumption is a hall mark of numerous cancers. This phenomenon while forming the basis for clinical imaging of cancer has not yet been targeted for therapy. Dr. Shanmugam has identified a uniquely regulated subset of tumor-specific glucose transporters that facilitate elevated glucose entry in myeloma and are proving to be promising targets for therapy. Suppression of these uniquely regulated/expressed transporters has been found to engage the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis via regulation of specific signaling cascades. Recent work has identified abnormalities in trafficking proteins that enable abnormal plasma membrane localization of these glucose transporters. She is also investigating metabolic reprogramming in resistance mechanisms elicited in response to glucose deprivation. Her research spans from understanding basic mechanism to pre-clinical translational studies in order to target tumor-specific glucose utilization. Dr. Shanmugams research has been funded by the Illinois Division of the American Cancer Society, the Wendy Wills Case Foundation and more recently the National American Cancer Society.

1002062	I have been studying biologic correlates of outcome measures in the context of the US Intergroup CHOP vs. Rituximab(R)-CHOP clinical trial for diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The addition of R to conventional CHOP chemotherapy either as induction or maintenance has now been shown to improve outcome in patients with DLBCL (both US and European trials).  My findings suggest this improvement in outcome is primarily due to the beneficial effect of R added to CHOP in the bcl-6 negative subset of DLBCL. Furthermore, addition of rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy, does NOT benefit patients who are bcl-6+, the majority of cases.  Differences between the clinical behavior of bcl-6 positive and negative lymphoma provide clues to the underlying biologic nature of DLBCL. Different therapeutic strategies may be designed to specifically target bcl-6-positive and negative DLBCL based upon differences in their underlying cell survival mechanisms and sensitivity to chemotherapy and rituximab. Analysis of additional biologic markers (p53, p21) is in progress.  Along with Dr. John Reed of the Burnham Institute, a long-standing collaborator, we are investigating protein expression of paracaspase in  lymphomas.In collaboration with Dr. E. Terry Papoutsakis of the Department of Chemical Engineering, NU, we are creating  gene expression arrays on follicular lymphomas to identify patterns of gene expression reflective of the nonmalignant cells component of the biopsy specimen, and their relationship to clinical outcome. Radioimmunotherapy using anti-CD20 reagents targets radiation to the malignant lymphocytes and their immediate neighbors by means of the cross-fire effect.  To improve outcomes, we have added Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan to conventional BEAM chemotherapy for patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant.  This was an investigator initiated phase I trial conducted under an investigator-held IND.  Colleagues at the Mayo Clinic were our co-investigators.  Forty-three patients were accrued to this study;  the maximal tolerated dose of Y-90-Ibritumomab tiuxetan is one that will deliver 1500 cGy to critical organs.  We are recommending a phase II trial of this radioimmunotherapeutic at 1.0 mCi/kg administering higher doses of Y-90-ibritumomab  tiuxetan be conducted prior to proceeding to a phase III randomized trial. Continuing in our efforts to develop novel therapies for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, I have written a phase I trial to combine bortezomib, the proteosome inhibitor, with Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan for patients with follicular lymphoma. This study has just opened.   Other clinical investigations include anti-idiotype vaccines, novel targeted agents such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and new monoclonal reagents such as the  anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody and an anti-CD22 chemoimmunoconjugate. In the context of our recently submitted SPORE in Lymphoma application, I will lead studies of targeted 'nanobins' created by Dr. O'Halloran, and help to develop bcl-6 peptide inhibitors for clinical use with Drs. Licht and Melnick (Albert Einstein).   
1002064	Dr Kahrilas' research focus is on esophageal and oropharyngeal physiology and pathophysiology.  Oropharyngeal studies are aimed at describing the normal mechanics of swallowing and the modifiability that can be imposed therapeutically.  These studies use computerized analysis of manometric and videofluorographic swallowing studies.  Pathophysiologic studies of the oropharynx focus on mechanisms that result in dysphagia and the efficacy of volitional compensatory strategies in modifying these defects.  Esophageal research has centered on the motor activity of the upper esophageal sphincter, peristaltic function, the pathophysiology of esophageal motor disorders, and the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Upper esophageal sphincter investigations utilized manometry and videofluoroscopy to describe reflexive response to esophageal stimuli, as well as normal activity during sleep, acid reflux, meals, and swallowing.  Studies of the esophageal body have described the contractile pattern of longitudinal muscle during peristalsis and are examining the efficacy of peristaltic function in effecting volume clearance and relating this quantitative assessment of peristaltic efficacy to the subjective experience of dysphagia.  Investigations of reflux disease are examining the mechanisms by which anatomic variables, inclusive of but not limited to hiatus hernia, interact with physiological responses to modulate disease severity.  A current research focus is on applying high-resolution solid-state manometry to the analysis of esophagogastric junction pathophysiology both with respect to reflux disease and esophageal motor disorders.  Previous research interests have included central nervous system neurophysiology, autonomic nervous system neurophysiology as it relates to sodium homeostasis, and screening for esophageal cancer.

Most of this time is spent on a genome-wide mutagenesis screen for genes involved in spermatogenesis. The second is the control of gene expression by estrogen receptor alpha via mechanisms that do not involve the classical estrogen response element in DNA (the so-called 'non-classical' mechanisms).

1002699	I. The Sonic hedgehog signal in vertebrates is mediated by three C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. Near identity of gene sequence exists between mouse and human GLI1.  We have shown that GLI1 functions as a transcription factor and that a critical domain in the COOH end of the protein is a transactivator with VP16-like structure. We established that GLI1 protein regulates a set of genes that coordinately control proliferation and may in part explain malignant transformation by mis-expression of GLI1. Post-transcriptional regulation of protein levels of GLI1 occur via the 3UTR of the human gene and this is an active area of research in the lab.                      II. The use of genetic mosaics in developmental analysis has been important for over 80 years.  Recently however, it has been possible to use mammalian mosaics and to perform analysis in situ allowing identification of cell lineage in visceral organs.  I used this system to establish that chemical induced tumors and preneoplastic lesions are clonal. The patterns observed in tissues of these animals derive from the allocation of stem cells during development and are the result of the primary forces : cell death, cell movement, and cell division.  We have shown that the patterns are conserved and regulated within the various tissues of the animals examined.  By using a combination of geometric analysis and computer simulation we have shown that the patterns are fractal, likely arise from iterating simple division rules, and do not require cell movement for complex highly variegated patterns to form. One of the prototypical patterns is evident in the cornea where epithelial cells are assorted in a whorled or pinwheel distribution.  We are using a variety of models; rat chimeras, mouse transgenics, live whole animal second harmonic imaging and explant culture to try and understand how this distribution occurs.

1003414	The body of work explores early detection of melanoma by skin self-examination (SSE) by those at risk to develop a melanoma. A research focus is the role of the dyadic relationship in performance of SSE. This research evolved from qualitative research in focus group testing of rulers and magnifying glasses to assist with SSE to a randomized trial of the educational and skills training intervention with qualitative measures by self-reported surveys and diaries. In order to improve the early detection of melanoma by physicians providing care, Dr. Robinson's research seeks to move beyond the usual didactic lectures with skin simulation models. The current model with multiple pigmented lesions affords medical students and primary care resident trainees the opportunity to learn the skills needed for early detection of melanoma. Simulation training modules build selfconfidence as the students and trainees master the skills of early detection of melanoma, counseling the patient, and performing a skin biopsy of a clinically suspicious pigmented lesion. The skin simulation interactive learning will enhance the reliability of healthcare provided by primary care physicians via opportunistic screening. Dr. Robinson's research interest over the last decade has also included prevention of skin cancer by harm reduction messages and educational interventions with teens and young adults with a particular focus on reducing indoor tanning and sun protection.

1004324	Effective psychological treatment today requires a flexibility of approach as well as the ability to ask the right psychological questions. By engaging patients quickly and thoroughly assessing clinical needs and resources, I am able to work with the patient in order to develop the proper mix of problem-focused interventions and more traditional psychotherapy. Each patient's problems and strengths must be evaluated on an individual basis. I view psychotherapy as a collaborative proceess in which the patient(s) and I work together in order to understand how current situations and past influences impact the well-being of the patient's current life and future goals. In addition to using a flexible approach to treatment, when appropriate, I communicate clearly with other professionals involved in treating the patient, couple, or family. I work with adults as individuals, couples, or parents, and with adolescents and families. Having trained in both clinical and developmental psychology gives me a unique life-span perspective in both normal and pathological psychological processes.

1004356	I am interested in identifying why learning becomes progressively more difficult with normal aging. With this broad goal in mind, I am studying the cellular properties of principle neurons of the hippocampus as an animal ages and after an animal has learned a task that involve the hippocampus. Thus far, my colleagues and I have identified that hippocampal pyramidal neurons (the principle output neurons of the hippocampus) become more excitable (that is, they are able to fire more action potentials) following successful learning. More importantly, the same population of neurons become less excitable with normal aging. Thus, it is our working hypothesis that the reduced excitability levels of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons with normal aging is a cause of the learning deficits observed in the aging population. We are currently using state of the art calcium imaging techniques to further characterize the changes in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons following learning and with normal aging. By systematically examining these cellular changes that occur following successful learning and with normal aging, a goal is to identify potential pharmacological targets to ameliorate and/or reverse the normal aging-related cognitive deficits. In addition, given that incidence of Alzheimer's disease increases with age, it is another goal of our research to translate our findings and approach to identify the cellular changes that occur in this debilitating condition.

1004472	Our laboratory has spent the past 15 years seeking to understand the mechanisms of fibrosis that occur in chronic, progressive kidney disease.  We have been studying the role of transforming growth factor (TGF-ﬂ) because it has been associated with a number of kidney diseases.  However, the classically described TGF-ﬂ/Smad signaling pathway is too simple to account for the multiple, sometimes contradictory effects of TGF-ﬂ on cell function. Therefore, we have sought to understand how cell phenotype and the molecular signature of a cell determine whether TGF-ﬂ signaling leads to fibrosis.  We have identified a number of non-canonical signaling pathways that interact with classical Smad signaling, and begun to establish the hierarchy among these pathways.  We are studying the manipulation of these pathways in vitro and in mouse models in an effort to translate our basic findings into therapeutic approaches to halting or preventing the progression of kidney disease.

1005100	Research in the Longnecker laboratory focuses on herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).  These viruses typically cause self-limiting disease within the human population but both can be associated with serious complications. EBV is associated with variety of hematopoietic cancers such as African Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's and adult T-cell leukemia.  EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired cellular immune deficiencies.  The two notable epithelial diseases associated with EBV infection are nasopharyngeal cancer and oral hairy leukoplakia.  Similar to EBV, HSV latent infections are very common in humans.  HSV typically does not cause severe disease but is associated with localized mucocutaneous lesions, but in some cases can cause meningitis and encephalitis. The Longnecker laboratory focuses on several aspects of EBV and HSV replication and pathogenesis.  First, the molecular basis EBV transformation and how it relates to cancer is being investigated. The laboratory is currently screening selective inhibitors that may be beneficial in EBV-associated cancers such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and proliferative disorders that occur in HIV/AIDS and transplant patients.  Second, the laboratory is investigating herpesvirus latency in human host.  In this regard, the laboratory is developing animal models for EBV latent infections. Finally, the laboratory is investigating the function of herpesvirus encoded proteins that are important in for infection and the interactions required with cellular receptors required for pathogenesis. Ultimately, studies by the Longnecker may provide insight for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of herpesvirus infections in humans and better understanding of the herpesvirus life cycle in the human host.

1005265	Our research aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic activation of glia in the brain, especially astrocytes and microglia, leads to damage of the neurons and progressive neurodegeneration in diseases like Alzheimer's disease. The overall goal is to utilize knowledge of potentially 'druggable' pathways to develop new therapeutics. The normal role of the glia is to cooperate with the neurons to keep the brain operating smoothly. When an injury or change in the brain occurs, the glia mount an inflammation response to fight off the insult and restore the brain to its proper functioning. But in neurodegenerative diseases, the glia are over-activated, producing a state called neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation can lead to nerve cell dysfunction or death, which is manifest as dementia. Although neuroinflammation appears to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of neurodegeneration, the molecular mechanisms underlying the process and approaches to downregulate the neuroinflammation have received little attention.

Drug Allergy-We are continuing our series of penicillin testing and protocol development for patients allergic to newer agents including immunomodulatory therapies.  3. Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis-Our series of patients is over 25; we are testing the notion that impaired responses by the innate immune defenses allow for Aspergillus fumigatus to escape containment and grow in the bronchial mucus. We continue to explore the utility of recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergens for diagnostic testing. 4. Reduction in allergic antibody in human allergic subjects- we are testing the notion that the combination of the neuropeptide, Substance P with low dose allergen administration can decrease the immediate cutaneous and clinical reactivity. The initial results of 8 allergic rhinitis subjects have been published. There is an active IND with the FDA, and we are enrolling more subjects for the controlled study and investigation into the mechanisms involved.

1006815	The three fundamental goals of my research are the following: 1) To understand the nature of the brain's own signals -- the 'language' in which movement commands are expressed by neurons in the central nervous system. 2) To understand the mechanisms by which these signals are produced -- the nature of the connections among networks of neurons, and the transformations that occur in the signals as they propagate throughout these networks. 3) To develop applications of these basic principles that could be of therapeutic value to human patients. Much of this work is done in collaboration with students and faculty from the Biomedical Engineering Department and the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program (NUIN).

1007168	Dr. Pachman's translational team studies juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), an often chronic pediatric systemic vasculopathy associated with skin inflammation and proximal muscle weakness of unknown etiology. Her laboratory has identified genetic and environmental factors that play a role in the onset of symptoms and govern outcome. The TNF-a-308 promoter A polymorphism is associated with prolonged disease course. Increased production of TNF-a protein is associated with the A allele throughout disease course, in contrast to serum levels of IFN-a activity, elevated early in the disease. Gene expression micro array studies of untreated children's diagnostic muscle biopsies identified massive dysregulation of IFN-a induced genes in JDM, similar to anti-viral immune model, which also shared features of the IFN-a signature characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Epigenetic and miRNA studies of diagnostic muscle biopsies indicate critical differences associated with disease duration. Dr. Pachmans search for clinically useful biomarkers of immune activation has identified CD3- natural killer cells and von Willebrand factor antigen, released from damaged endothelial cells.  With chronic inflammation, progressive endothelial damage is reflected by loss of nailfold capillary end row loops (they developed a quantitative system of analysis)associated with lack of absorption of oral prednisone.  In addition, her lab maintains a patient-derived sample repository of diagnostic muscle and skin biopsies, sequential sera, peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphocyte culture supernatant fluid, and dystrophic calcifications samples keyed to a sequential database and an analytical database software and bio-informatics system.  In summary, this intensive research effort broadens the clinical, genetic and immunological characterization of the child with JDM, which is a critical aid in guiding current therapy and may lead to novel targeted interventions.

1007992	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a significant medical condition and current treatment options are ineffective in diabetic patients and in prostate cancer patients treated by prostatectomy.  Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is an essential regulator of penile smooth muscle, cavernous nerve (CN) integrity and CN regeneration that has significant potential to be developed as a treatment to prevent ED by regenerating the CN and by suppressing penile apoptosis.  In our laboratory we examine fundamental mechanisms that underlie cavernous nerve regulation of penile morphology during development, how these mechanisms become altered with peripheral neuropathy of the cavernous nerve in diabetic rats and how manipulation of SHH signaling can be used to speed cavernous nerve repair in diabetic models.  
1008044	Dentin phosphophoryn (DPP), the major noncollagenous protein of tooth dentin matrix is synthesized as dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) by the mesenchyme-derived odontoblasts. We have found a spatio-temporal expression during mouse embryonic development in cells of epithelial origin. At day-13 of embryonic gestation, DPP was localized to the enamel organ at  the developing tooth cap stage, with heaviest immuno-histochemical staining at the oral ectoderm but was also prominent in the inner enamel epithelium. Interestingly, at the same embryonic stage, DPP was also expressed in the ureteric bud branches of the metanephric kidney and in the alveolar epithelial buds of the developing lung. No expression was seen in the mesenchymal component of either organ. Interestingly inclusion of anti-DPP antibodies in E-13 organ cultures of kidneys harvested from wild type mice, altered ureteric bud morphogenesis and caused looseness of the metanephric mesenchyme. These findings suggest that besides its role in mineralization of the dentin, DPP modulates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in meristic tissues during embryonic development. Another focus in our laboratory has been studies directed towards understanding the mechanism of mineralization in vertebrate tissues such as bone and tooth and in sea urchin tooth in invertebrates and the role of extracellular constituents of connective tissue in this complex process.  The acidic protein constituent part of extracellular matrix has been implicated in mineral deposition but the precise series of molecular reaction mechanism remains undefined. In invertebrate systems, where the mineral part is calcite or aragonite the mechanisms of molecular calcification remains even much less understood compared to vertebrates where mineral deposition is chiefly calcium hydroxyapatite. We are studying whether it is the nature of the protein or environment that determines whether we get Calcium Carbonate  or Calcium Phosphate crystals

1008970	The major cause of mortality from prostate cancer is metastatic disease for which there is currently no effective cure.  For reasons that remain incompletely understood, bone is the most common site for prostate cancer metastasis.  Reciprocal signaling between invading prostate cancer cells and host bone stromal cells is central to metastatic tumor development.  Understanding these cell-cell interactions will lead to effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent/arrest metastatic spread of prostate carcinoma. My current research stems from the hypothesis that prostate cancer cells and bone cells interact via the hedgehog signaling pathway to promote bone metastasis.  Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a member of the hedgehog family of ligands that activate an intracellular signaling cascade upon binding to transmembrane receptors (Patched) leading to transcriptional regulation of specific target genes by the Gli family of transcription factors.  Our previous work has demonstrated that Shh-expressing epithelial cells and Gli-expressing mesenchymal cells in embryonic mouse prostate interact via the Shh-Gli pathway to promote cell proliferation and ductal morphogenesis.  We have also shown that the genes for Shh and Gli are expressed in human prostate cancer, and that Shh-expressing prostate cancer cells and Gli-expressing stroma collaborate to promote prostate tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.  Our present research extends these observations and investigates signaling interactions via the Shh-Gli pathway between prostate cancer cells and bone cells to promote prostate carcinoma metastasis, using both in vitro and in vivo models.

1009779	Dr. Pope directs a basic science laboratory, which is focused on rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that affects women much more commonly than men.  Dr. Pope's laboratory has focused on characterizing the basic mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.  The work focuses on the role of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  His studies are directed at defining the mechanisms that promote resistance to apoptosis or programmed cell death.  They are aimed at defining the potential role of the induction of apoptosis as a therapeutic approach in this disease.  To this end his laboratory is characterizing the mechanisms that protect rheumatoid arthritis macrophages and synovial fibroblasts from apoptosis.  Investigators in his laboratory identified the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, Flice Like Inhibitory Protein (FLIP), during monocyte to macrophage differentiation.  They have demonstrated that FLIP is highly expressed in the rheumatoid joint and is responsible for protecting rheumatoid arthritis macrophages from Fas-mediated apoptosis.  His laboratory is further characterizing the mechanisms for the basal expression of FLIP, and that observed following activation by cytokines and toll-like receptor ligands.  Further, studies are aimed at defining the mechanisms of macrophage cell death that occurs following TNF or Toll-like receptor ligation when NF-kB activation is suppressed.  The aim of these studies is to identify potential therapeutic targets for intervention in rheumatoid arthritis.  Additional studies are directed at determining the role of Fas-Fas ligand interactions on the promotion of chronic inflammation, which occurs by sensitizing the macrophages to activation through the Toll/IL-1 receptor pathway.  Additional studies have identified Mcl-1, another Bcl-2 family member, which is critical for the survival of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  Studies have demonstrated that Mcl-1 is highly expressed in the rheumatoid joint, in both macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  Ongoing studies are directed at defining the unique mechanisms that control the expression of Mcl-1 in macrophages and synovial fibroblasts.  Both cell types appear critically dependent on Mcl-1 for survival and ongoing studies are aimed at defining the potential role of modulating mcl-1 expression or function as a therapeutic target in experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis.The goal of this program is to develop new therapies, employing apoptosis as a therapeutic tool.  Dr. Pope s laboratory also collaborates with Dr. Ramsey-Goldman, developing and performing some of the assays used to evaluate osteoporosis in her patients with lupus.  These include assays to quantitative osteoprotegerin and Rank ligand as well as microarray analysis of monocytes and macrophages from patients with lupus.

1011314	The quality of parent-child relationships during infancy has long-term and significant implications for a child's healthy adaptation. Primary care pediatricians have unique opportunities to support early family relationships because of their repeated encounters with families for well child care. My research and teaching interests have been focused on how emerging parent-infant relationships can be supported by pediatricians and on the impact that the quality of those relationships can have on the practice of primary care pediatrics. In the initial phase of my research, I developed and validated a research protocol for observing and understanding meaningful patterns of interaction that occur between parents and infants during well child visits. Next, I modified the observational system for clinical use, integrated it into Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics training for pediatric residents and studied its influence on recognition, guidance and documentation in well child care visits. My present interests revolve around exploring mechanisms by which the parent-child relationship may contribute to aspects of child health and behavior that are integral to the provision of comprehensive pediatric primary care. I am currently exploring whether there are pathways that include parent-child relationship quality that predict early childhood obesity. I hope this research will lead to identifying families with children at-risk for early obesity who might benefit from early intervention targeting parent-child interactions, parental sensitivity to infant cues and, more broadly, parent-child relationships in lieu of, or in addition to, traditional interventions for obesity. A second line of current research examines parental perceptions and actions around early infant regulation. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship of feeding methods, parenting practices, parent and infant characteristics on the development of infant regulation over the first 18 months.

1011559	Project 1. Atherosclerosis - the main cause of cardiovascular disease - is now understood to result from a chronic inflammation of large arterial blood vessels superimposed upon by high plasma LDL levels, as well as other risk factors. Plasma LDL levels are controlled, in part, by the rate of their clearance from circulation. About 60% of the LDL cleared fron the plasma occurs through the mediation of the LDL receptor, mainly in the liver. The remaining is cleared by an as yet uncharacterized hepatic LDL receptor-independent mechanism. We are currently investigating the possibility that the LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), a trans-membrane co-receptor for Wnt signaling, mediates the clearance of LDL from the plasma.  Project 2. Considerable evidence suggests that auto-immunity plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Stephen Miller (Microbiology) we are investigating the effectiveness of tolerance-induced by atherosclerosis-specific antigen-coupled cells in preventing the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in mouse-models of this disease.  .

1011901	At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Dr. Slutzky sees both general neurology and epilepsy patients. In addition to his clinical responsibilities, Dr. Slutzky pursues research interests in neural prosthetics, specifically brain-machine interfacing (BMI).  A device that records signals from the cerebral cortex, decodes them, and uses them to control a variety of outputs such as a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or electrically-stimulated muscles in a paralyzed limb, a brain-machine interface could allow a severely motor impaired patient (quadriplegic or locked-in, for example from ALS or spinal cord injury) to interact with his or her environment and potentially regain the use of a limb again. In addition, this technology provides a powerful new way to study normal in vivo brain physiology. Dr. Slutzkys ultimate goal is to refine BMIs to the point that they can safely and effectively be used in humans for long-term applications. He recently received a NIH K08 career development award to investigate different brain signal sources as inputs to a BMI.
1011912	Woodruffs role in understanding inhibin fluctuation in the ovary led to questions about ovarian follicle formation and persistence, which provides new ways to think about fertility preservation for young women with fertility-threatening conditions (NEJM, 2009).  She examined the regulation of follicle function in vitro and established a collaboration with a biomaterial scientist, Lonnie Shea, to develop a 3-dimensional support system that would provide the necessary bio-integrity for follicle growth (Tissue Eng. 9:1013, 2003; News and Views in Nat. Med. 14:1178, 2008 and Nat. Med. 14:1182).  These studies have been very productive and the current culture system supports live births of mice. The system is being adopted to non-human primate and human ovarian follicles. She coined the term oncofertility to describe this work.  Finally, she has used physiological studies together with mathematical modeling to explore the kinetics of follicle formation and persistence in the mouse (Dev. Biol. 298:149 and Dev. Biol. 298:132). These studies reveal the necessary and sufficient nature of the initial follicle pool established in the ovary during the time of development (Nature Med, 14:1190, 2008). Hallmarks of Woodruff career have included a strong focus on ovarian biology, on interdisciplinary approaches to problems, and application of the overall health of women.

1012336	Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus which latently infects the majority of adults.  Reactivation of latent virus occurs frequently, and in immunocompromised individuals, such as recipients of solid organ and bone marrow transplants, reactivation of CMV is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The primary focus of research in our lab is the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which cytomegalovirus (CMV) establishes latent infection, in which the DNA is present but no virus is produced, and the mechanisms by which the virus reactivates, starts actively replicating and induces disease in vivo.  Using murine CMV as a model system, our studies have shown that the virus establishes latency by shutting down viral gene expression through recruitment of transcriptional repressors to the viral genome.  We have developed a unique kidney transplant model for studying reactivation of the virus which closely approximates clinical settings in which reactivation occurs, and we are investigating molecular signaling pathways that lead to transcriptional reactivation of viral gene expression.  This may lead to identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention which could prevent reactivation of CMV and its associated pathologies.

1012563	The overarching goal of my involvement in translational research is to improve the outcome of patients with lymphoma.  With scientists in the US and abroad, we are currently investigating novel signaling pathways in lymphoma, using cell lines and animal model systems.  More specifically, our research focuses on the biology of reactive oxygen species signaling pathways in lymphoma.  Active investigations include: 1) the biology of the lactone diterpenoids in lymphoma; 2) the development of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and curcumin loaded nanodisks as a drug delivery vehicle in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), in collaboration with investigators from the Childrens Hospital Research Institute (CHORI) in Oakland, CA  3) The characterization of cholesterol efflux pumps as a target in lymphoma, in collaboration with Dr Colby Shad Thaxton from the Department of Urology and the Northwestern University Center of Cancer Nanotechnology excellence; 4) the study of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in lymphoma, in collaboration with Dr. Paul Schumacker. Clinical research interests include the study of novel immune stimulatory strategies following stem cell transplant in lymphoma with collaborators in Israel, Europe and the US, new approaches to the use of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in lymphoma, and new treatment paradigms based on the basic investigations described above  Clinical research studies are carried out through the Northwestern University Lymphoma Program and through national co-operative groups such as the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), SPORE programs in lymphoma and through the NCI Phase II Consortium in collaboration with investigators at the University of Chicago.

1012598	Clinically, I predominantly treat inflammatory bowel disease patients where I specialize in the use of immunomodulatory therapies. On a research level, my lab is involved in understanding the mechanisms for colitis-induced colon cancer. We focus on regulation of intestinal stem cells using genetically altered mouse models and analysis of human biopsy tissue.
1012598	The Barrett lab investigates mechanisms of epithelial stem cell activation in mouse and human models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Areas of interest include studying the cooperation between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Wnt in activating beta catenin signaling (He et al Nat Gen 2007). We find that intestinal inflammation increases PI3K-activated beta catenin in intestinal epithelial progenitor and stem cell populations. We propose that this pathway will be a novel target in strategies for chemoprevention (e.g. colitis-induced cancer) and recovery from radiation-induced stem cell injury (e.g. after nuclear attack). In all projects of the lab we strive to have strong translational components by testing lab-generated hypotheses in patient material.

1013078	I help patients who struggle with emotional and compulsive overeating understand the connection between their experience of stress and their lack of control over their eating. Understanding this connection helps motivate patients to focus on the cause of the problem rather than the effect, and to develop more effective coping strategies to overcome their reliance on food as a short-term coping mechanism. My research interests include psychological models of behavioral self-control, motivation for healthy lifestyle change, and the causes and treatment of patient non-adherence.
1013105	We are using multiple myeloma as a model to understand the actions of glucocorticoids (GC) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).  Development of resistance to GCs remains a critical clinical problem which involves the loss of GR expression.

1013559	Being on the pioneering team of lasers in dental surgery and from co-authoring the first textbook on the subject, I have always been interested in Lasers and their clinical use in dental surgery. Also, their effects on tissues versus those effects of more conventional means and how lasers improve the quality of life of our patients.  I have another large interest in the use of Connective Tissue for Dental Surgical Grafting and further its use via minimally invasive surgical techniques.  With connective tissue we are now able to make complete repairs on exposed roots of teeth. With the Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft and with the correct indicators we can create for a 100 per cent repair of tissue and bone and hence complete root coverage and the saving of teeth and surrounding structures.  Also, the use of mathematical formulas to create for correct width to length ratios when creating surgical aesthetic crown lengthening procedures as part of surgical-restorative procedures and reconstruction.  Finally, the use of immediate dental implants and their placement relative to the extraction socket and via the use of a minimally invasive technique (an atraumatic incisionless-flapless-no suturing technique) to yield predictable restorative outcomes and hence better aesthetics, minimal pain, bleeding and swelling and therefore a better quality of life for our patients.

1014980	My primary research focus at FSM is placed on understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying endogenous mediator-mediated protection against tissue injury and regulation of immunity at intestinal mucosa.  I have established and sustained an R01 research program in the area of gastroenterology.  My research group has shown that: (1) Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), a goblet cell-derived protein, protects intestinal epithelial cells against injury through an NF-kappaB dependent mechanism.  Furthermore, we demonstrated that TFF3 triggers a transient activation of NF-kappaB and prolonged upregulation of Twist protein (a molecule essential for downregulation of NF-kappaB activity in vivo) in intestinal epithelial cells via an ERK kinase-mediated pathway. (2) Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8, macrophage-derived protein) promotes the migration of intestinal epithelial cells through a PKCepsilon-dependent mechanism.  It plays an important role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis and the promotion of mucosal healing. (3) Peptidoglycan, a potent immune adjuvant derived from bacterial cell walls, is taken up and crosses intestinal barrier by crypt-based immature intestinal epithelial cells.  Furthermore, we defined a novel cellular mechanism/pathway through which intestinal luminal peptidoglycan is transcytosed across intestinal epithelia.  In addition, we revealed that the absorbed peptidoglycan targets macrophages, which may facilitate intestinal immune homeostasis.  Together, our findings in conjunction with previous investigations, have elucidated molecular mechanisms underlying the trialogue occurred among lumenal contents, epithelial lining, and cells in lamina propria that directs process for the maintenance of intestinal barrier homeostasis, integrity, and immunity.

Currently my studies are focused on the plakin protein, desmoplakin, an obligate member of the desmosomal plaque, which mediates the interaction between the plaque and the intermediate filament network. This interaction with the intermediate filament network is required for maintaining tissue integrity, particularly those tissues undergoing large amounts of stress, such as the heart and skin. The importance of desmoplakin in maintaining adhesive strength is highlighted by cardiomyopathies and skin diseases, which result from desmoplakin mutations. Utilizing biochemistry and fixed and live cell imaging techniques we are analyzing the dynamics of desmoplakin during desmosome formation and the roles the intermediate filament and microfilament networks play in that process.

1018246	The long-term goal of my lab is to identify and investigate molecules that play important roles in mammalian hearing, thus to enrich our understanding of cochlear physiology, and to further develop a better strategy to prevent hearing loss.  Outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for providing high sensitivity and frequency selectivity of hearing.  They are also the most vulnerable cells in the inner ear and are involved in most sensorineural hearing loss that affects the hearing of millions of people.  It is known that OHC death is strongly connected with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Yet, it is not fully understood why OHCs, as compared to other cells in the organ of Corti, are more vulnerable to ROS.  The main function of OHCs is to amplify mechanical signals through their somatic electromotility.  This exclusive property is executed by a unique motor protein called prestin (Zheng et al., Nature, 2000).  We are currently investigating prestins protective role against oxidative stress in the ear using different prestin-expressing cell lines and prestin-knockout/prestin-knockin animal models.  We are focused on understanding the molecular mechanism of motor protein prestin using various cellular, biochemical and molecular biological methods including high throughput small molecule compound library screening procedures.  These studies will not only expand knowledge of prestin as the OHC-based cochlear amplifier at the molecular level, but also produce a deeper understanding of mechanisms associated with outer hair cells loss, and may offer new methods for the prevention of OHC damage.

1018621	Research in the Turek laboratory is focused on the study of sleep and circadian rhythms, with special interest in identifying genes that regulate sleep and circadian rhythms. Ongoing work on sleep and circadian rhythms includes an investigation of: (1) the neurochemical, molecular, and cellular events involved in the entrainment, generation and expression of circadian rhythms arising from a central biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, (2) the genetics of the circadian clock system and the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the sleep-wake cycle, (3) the feedback effects of the sleep-wake cycle on the circadian clock regulating the timing of that cycle, (4) the effects of advanced age on the expression of behavioral and endocrine rhythms, and on the expression of circadian clock genes, 5) the links between sleep, circadian rhythms and energy metabolism and, (6) the role of melatonin in modulating sleep and circadian rhythms. In addition to our work on rodents, we have established extensive collaborations with clinical researchers. Studies in humans are aimed at shifting the human clock in an attempt to alleviate mental and physical problems that are associated with disorders in circadian time-keeping, particularly in the elderly and in shift-workers. In addition, we are using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to determine if we can reverse the effects of aging on the circadian clock system in both rodents and humans. Our sleep, circadian and metabolic studies are focused on how disruption in these interactions can lead to obesity, diabetes and CVD.

1018731	In my laboratory we study the cellular and molecular  mechanisms of immunopathogenesis of T cell-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases, the  chemokine regulation of cell migration and host responses to mucosal bacterial infection, and the role of chemokines in the migration of B cell lymphoma.  The laboratory employs two mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS): Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease (a virus-induced model of MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (an autoimmune model of MS). In particular, the laboratory is examining the chemokine and chemokine receptor biology of T cell, monocyte, and dendritic cell recruitment during CNS demyelinating disease.  In addition, we are examining the balance between cellular and molecular mechanisms of oral tolerance induction and generation of mucosal immunity/host defense to bacterial and viral pathogens.  Finally, the laboratory uses a model of murine B cell lymphoma to study the mechanisms of tumor cell migration to lymphoid and extra-lymphoid tissues.  The approaches utilized in the laboratory are applicable to both the understanding of basic biologic mechanisms of  disease progression and treatment of autoimmune diseases, enhancement of immunity to pathogens, and treatment of cancer.

Professors David Engman, MD, PhD, Conrad Epting, MD, and Bria Coates MD, lead the team.   TROPICAL DISEASE RESEARCH. Trypanosomes are single-celled parasites that cause human illnesses such as African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease. These illnesses cause tremendous morbidity and death among millions in the tropical world and Chagas is an emerging infection in the U.S. with an estimated half-million infected residents. We study the molecular genetics and cell biology of these organisms both to understand fundamental processes of cell function and to identify novel targets for drug discovery.  AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH. A variety of infections and other insults to the heart can cause cardiac autoimmunity, a process by which the immune system mistakenly attacks the heart as if it were an infectious agent. We study both infectious and purely autoimmune models of autoimmune myocarditis in a global effort to understand the development of autoimmunity and mechanisms of autoimmune tissue destruction, and to use this knowledge to develop novel strategies to prevent autoimmune damage. We are also interested in the interactions of infectious agents and cells of the immune system with the endothelium, the lining of blood vessels across which both need to cross to mediate or fight disease.

1021762	The research in my lab is centered on the espins, a novel family of multifunctional actin-bundling proteins, and the elucidation of their roles in the organization and function of the actin cytoskeleton of hair cell stereocilia and sensory cell microvilli. Espins are produced in multiple isoforms from a single gene. They are present in the parallel actin bundle of hair cell stereocilia and are the target of mutations that cause deafness and vestibular dysfunction in mice and humans. For example, the jerker frameshift mutation in the espin gene of mice causes recessive hereditary deafness and vestibular dysfunction accompanied by abnormal stereociliary morphogenesis and accelerated stereociliary degeneration. In particular, the stereocilia of jerker homozygotes, which lack espin proteins, fail to increase in diameter, suggesting that espins are required for the appositional growth of the stereociliary parallel actin bundle. Espins are also present at high concentration in the microvilli of taste receptor cells, solitary chemoreceptor cells, vomeronasal sensory neurons and Merkel cells, raising the possibility that these proteins play important, general roles in the microvillar projections of vertebrate sensory cells. Unlike other actin-bundling proteins found in the microvilli and stereocilia of vertebrates, espins are potent actin-bundling proteins that are not inhibited by calcium ion. In addition, espins are unusually effective at over-twisting actin filaments in parallel actin bundles and can do so even at low stoichiometry. In cells, espins efficiently elongate parallel actin bundles and, thereby, help determine the dimensions of microvilli and stereocilia. Espins can also bind actin monomer via their Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domain in vitro and in vivo and can assemble actin bundles in cells. These biological activities distinguish espins from other actin-bundling proteins and may make them especially well-suited to sensory cells.

1022350	Autopsy pathology, Liver and pancreatic pathology<BR><BR> Our current work focuses on the molecular mechanisms responsible for PPAR action. Transcription of specific genes initiated by transcription factors/nuclear receptors is a complex process and involves the participation of multiprotein complexes composed of transcription coactivators. Coactivators contain one or more highly conserved LXXLL (L, leucine; X, any amino acid) motif for direct interaction with AF-2 (activation function 2) region in nuclear receptor.  Our laboratory cloned PBP, PRIP, PIMT, PRIC285 and PRIC320 using either yeast two-hybrid screening or by isolating receptor binding proteins and their identification by MALDI-TOF analysis. We are generating gene knockout mouse models to elucidate the role of these coactivators in the regulation of specific gene transcription. Our work demonstrated that the deletion of PBP, PRIP PIMT and PRIC320  genes in the mouse results in embryonic lethality, indicating that these are vital for development and they alter the function of many nuclear receptors and other transcription factors during critical developmental stages. Recent developments in the area of conditional targeted somatic mutagenesis have opened new avenues for analyzing the physiological functions of coactivator signaling in a variety of tissues and cell types during early development and in the adult.

1025933	The research goal of myself, with the Schnaper lab, is to elucidate a cellular mechanism by which renal fibrosis progress and to seek for potential therapeutic/preventive approach, with focus on molecular mechanisms for function of a fibrogenic cytokine, TGF-ﬂ. Due to a pleiotrophic nature of this cytokine, multiple factors other than directly downstream transcription factor, Smad, are involved in its regulation.   I have characterized several of those pathways using cultured kidney epithelial or mesangial cells as model systems. My recent work that connected those signaling events with a function of cellular receptor of the extracellular matrix, integrins, has added a new dimension to the project.  The lab is now applying our previous findings in vitro in a mice model of renal fibrosis. Our recent data (unpublished) show that the renal fibrosis in this model is dependent on both TGF-ﬂ and PI3K pathways.  Interestingly, a d isoform of PI3K appears to play a role for podocyte damage, whereas up-regulation of TGF-ﬂ followed by the initial podocyte damage mediates fibrotic processes.   These data are critical to further understanding of multiple steps involved to achieve final image of renal fibrosis.

1026398	Dr. Whitington's research involves the study of immune mechanisms of pediatric liver diseases.  Our lab has identified an alloimmune mechanism of fetal liver injury, a process we call gestational alloimmune liver disease, which is the cause of most or all cases of neonatal hemochromatosis and is the likely cause of most cases of liver failure in the first 3 months of life.  We also suspect it to be a major cause of intrauterine fetal demise.  We are also investigating the immune mechanisms of biliary atresia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, as well as mechanisms of fibrogenesis (a byproduct of immune activation) in genetic cholestasis, neonatal hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and hepatic allografts.

1026407	Research activities of our group focus on two major clinical areas: musculoskeletal pain and bone.  In the area of musculoskeletal pain, the development and characterization of analgesic agents for the management of osteoarthritis has been a major focus for over the past decade.  We have helped design and implement phase 2 studies of many of the major classes of drugs currently in use, including NSAIDs, cox-2 selective inhibitors, opioids, topical analgesic agents and novel approaches to pain including antibodies to NGF (nerve growth factor) and other agents active on the peripheral nervous system.  In the areas of chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis, our group has worked closely with Dr. A. Vania Apkarian in the Department of Physiology to describe and understand spontaneous chronic pain with a particular focus of the role of the cerebral cortex.  Current NIH-funded studies are evaluating the transition that occurs in some individuals who progress from acute to chronic pain in order to understand the changes that occur with the hope of eventually being able to modulate cortical activity to produce better clinical outcomes. Bone loss is known to be a major problem for individuals with disabilities, particularly those who are not able to ambulate or bear weight normally.  Our group has initiated studies aimed at treating patients with acute spinal cord injury to attempt to maintain bone mass during their immediate post-injury period.  In those individuals with SCI who have already lost significant bone mass, we have undertaken a second set of studies aimed at evaluating approaches to increase bone mass in these individuals, using physical and pharmacological interventions.

1027443	The Bohn lab is developing gene and stem cell therapies for Parkinsons disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)using experimental rodent models of these diseases. Previous studies  focused on gene therapy with the neurotrophic factor, glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) which the group has shown slows the progression of dopamine neuron loss in rat models of PD.  A phase I clinical trial testing GDNF gene therapy will commence soon. The lab is currently studying viral vector mediated gene silencing of alpha-synuclein, a gene linked to familiar forms of Parkinsons disease.  In addition, the lab is generating neuroprogenitor-like cells and neurospheres from rat and mouse bone marrow and determining whether this interesting source of stem cells can be developed as a novel therapy for PD.  Studies of the effects of rat bone marrow derived neurospheres are also being tested for effects on traumatic brain injury.  Viral vectors harboring neurotrophic factors are also being made for studies aimed at reversing aging of dopamine neurons in rat hypothalamus and targeting upper motoneurons in mouse models of ALS.  The experimental approaches in the lab are multi-faceted and employ techniques ranging from making viral vectors to molecular and morphometric assays  to behavioral testing.

1029930	My current research focus is on characterizing the signaling pathways that regulate endothelial cell behavior leading to the process of blood vessel development (angiogenesis).  In particular, I am interested in characterizing the role of the a4 laminin subunit, a component of the basement membrane of endothelial cells in blood vessel development.  I have previously demonstrated that a4 laminin contributes to angiogenesis by interacting with avb3 integrin and b1 integrin containing heterodimers.  I plan to further unravel the signaling mechanisms underlying a4 laminin dependent angiogenesis, to identify the critical phosphorylation events and to determine the role of apoptosis in the endothelial cell response to a4 laminin.  I am also interested in characterizing the signaling pathways that are involved in either enhancing or blocking the differentiation process of endothelial progenitor cells to endothelial cells.  Endothelial progenitor cells have been implicated in the development of new blood vessels during normal and pathological angiogenesis.  However, the mechanism and extracellular signals that initiate and regulate this process are poorly understood.

1030041	Dr Kuikens research group is working developing bionic technologies to improve the function of artificial limbs for people with very proximal amputations.  The main research focus of the lab is developing a technique using nerve transfers to improve of myoelectric prosthesis control called targeted reinnervation.  By transferring the residual arm nerves in an upper limb amputee to spare regions of muscle it is possible to make new signals for the control of robotic arms. This allows simultaneous control of multiple joints in a natural way.  The procedure has been very successful in patients with increases in speed of 50- 500%. Similarly, hand sensation nerves can be directed to reinnervate spare skin in or near the residual limb so that when this skin is touched, the amputee feels like their missing hand is being touched including light touch, graded pressure hot/cold, sharp/dull and vibration. This is an exciting pathway to producing true sensory feedback to amputees from their prosthesis.

1031304	My research focuses on spinal motor-system. I am interested in the interaction between pre-motor interneurons and motoneurons; the synaptic plasticity of motoneurons for peripheral and brainstem descending pathways; and the mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Using a root recording system I developed for mouse spinal cord study, I have demonstrated the existence of two forms of short-term plasticity in the spinal motoneurons in response to different source of synaptic inputs. Further studies in this direction will move toward the cellular level to understand their pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms.  In an animal model of ALS (mSOD1 mouse), I have found that NMDA receptors in the spinal interneurons might be an important component contributing to motoneurons' excitotoxicity. Further studies will apply intracellular recording and calcium image techniques to answer that through what ions, channels and/or receptors the interneurons interact with motoneurons in mSOD1 mouse in order to determine new therapeutic targets for this disease.

1033423	Building And Re-Building Of Limbs And Hearts. The Simon Laboratory has identified regulartory genes that play key roles in limb development in virtually all vertebrates, including humans. Surprisingly, these genes are also critical for the shaping of the heart during embryogenesis and when mutated in humans, they lead to birth defects of the arms and heart. Using zebrafish and mouse models, the lab tries to gain a deeper understanding of common genetic pathways in limb and heart development and disease. In addition to these developmental studies, the lab is interested in discovering the genes that are involved in regenerative processes. As models for these investigations, zebrafish and newts are employed, which can regenerate limbs and heart ventricles throughout their life times. The identification of genetic pathways that are operational in these regenerating species but not in mammals, will provide new insights how to restore regenerative abilities in non-regenerating species including humans.

1034453	Our group seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which human prostate cancer cells regulate motility (and thus ultimately metastasis), to identify new drugs which target regulatory elements, and to evaluate their efficacy in humans.  Studies employ basic cell and molecular biology based investigations, animal models of metastasis, and early phase clinical trials involving cell and molecular based endpoints.  A central focus is upon the role of transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) associated signaling members.  Through these studies we have been able to link TGFb super family receptors, Smad proteins, members of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway, small heat shock proteins (in particular, HSP27), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), into an inter-linked regulatory network within the cell, which together regulates cell motility, invasion, and metastasis.  We have identified a lead compound that effectively blocks activation of the key regulatory elements.  Our lead compound inhibits metastasis in murine orthotopic models, was well tolerated in human phase I trials, and demonstrates mechanistically relevant cell and molecular efficacy in phase II human trials.

1034656	A major pediatric research priority and the long-term goal of my laboratory is the identification of the etiology and pathogenesis of Kawasaki Disease (KD), the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed nations. KD can result in coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) formation with resultant myocardial infarction and/or sudden death. Clinical and epidemiologic data are consistent with an infectious cause of KD, but conventional methods have not yielded the etiologic agent. We discovered that oligoclonal IgA plasma cells, CD8 T lymphocytes, and macrophages infiltrate CAA and other tissues in acute KD, indicating an antigen-driven response to an intracellular pathogen, such as a virus, with a mucosal portal of entry. We made oligoclonal KD antibodies in vitro and used them as tools to identify their target antigens. Immunohistochemistry revealed that KD synthetic antibodies detected antigen in acute KD but not control bronchial epithelium and in a subset of macrophages in acute inflamed KD tissues. In acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium, antigen localized to distinctive perinuclear intracytoplasmic spheroids. Light and electron microscopy revealed that the spheroids in ciliated bronchial epithelium were cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (CIB). The CIB were most consistent with aggregates of protein and associated nucleic acid and likely derive from the KD etiologic agent. These data support the hypothesis that the KD agent enters via the respiratory tract, infects bronchial epithelium, and travels in macrophages to targeted tissues including coronary arteries, with antigen-specific IgA plasma cells and other inflammatory cells entering the tissues to combat the pathogen and resulting in tissue damage. The presence of CIB consistent with aggregates of microbial, likely viral, proteins and nucleic acids in acute KD lung provides a structural and molecular footprint that could lead to identification of the KD etiologic agent.
1034762	<BR><BR> My research work is focused on studying the mechanisms that regulate the transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors constitute a large superfamily of transcription factors that regulate a diverse array of biological processes, including development and neoplasia, as well as energy and xenobiotic metabolism. In order to initiate transcription, some more factors are required to interact with nuclear receptors and to regulate their activities. These factors are collectively called 'nuclear receptor co-factors'. Several co-factors have been identified by our studies. Generating mouse models using gene targeting technology to investigate the functions of these genes is in process.

1035648	Holly Falk-Krzesinski, PhD, is Research Assistant Professor and Director, Research Team Support & Development at the NIH CTSA-supported Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science (NUCATS) Institute.  My research activities involve collaboration enhancement and research development and grantsmanship for clinical and translational team-based, cross-disciplinary research.  Connecting the science of team science (research on scientific teams) with the praxis of team science (the practical aspects of science performed in teams), I translate empirical research findings about team science into evidence-based effective practices for scientific teams, institutions, and funders of collaborative team science.  Two areas of application on which I focus are tools and training.  I have been working on the development and implementation of research networking tools, knowledge management systems for the research enterprise, to support the efforts of researchers and research development professionals to initiate and nurture new interdisciplinary partnerships and secure collaborative extramural research funding.  And, in an effort to prepare trainees and investigators to engage effectively in collaborative research and team science, I have recently developed two interdisciplinary, team science training resources: a graduate-level Team Science course and TeamScience.net, an online learning tool.  I am now developing a workshop series focused on leadership and team science.  Finally, I chair the Annual International Science of Team Science (SciTS) Conference, through which I am working to develop a strong, interdisciplinary community of practice for team science, SciTS, and interdisciplinary research training.
1035819	I am committed to a career in patient-oriented research related to pulmonary vascular disease. Exploring the clinical impact and the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with underlying lung disease is my primary research interest. This interest stems from my clinical experience over the last several years developing and building the Northwestern Pulmonary Hypertension Program. Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication seen in patients with lung disease, specifically chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although the association between the presence of PH in COPD and increased mortality has been well described, we have recently explored the impact of PH on patient-centered outcomes. I am interested in exploring the mechanisms of PH and identifying the disease as it presents early in the course of lung disease when interventions could potentially alter disease progression.

Our studies utilize a broad range of approaches, including molecular and cellular techniques as well as animal models and epidemiologic studies on human populations.
1036135	The major focus of my academic interest has been the study of newborn vascular biology. I spent my fellowship and early faculty years studying extracorporeal life support (ECMO) in newborn infants under the direction of Dr. Thomas P. Green. I entered the laboratory of Dr. James Russell in 1990 and learned techniques to investigate basic mechanisms regulating vascular tone. I have gone on to apply this knowledge to better understand the normal development of the perinatal pulmonary circulation, and to determine specific abnormalities that result in persistent pulmonary hypertension. My recent work has utilized intact animal and bench approaches to investigate the role of oxidant stress in the vascular dysfunction and remodeling that characterizes PPHN. We have not only identified enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species, but have also shown that antioxidant strategies reverse the physiologic and enzymatic abnormalities of PPHN. In collaboration with Dr. Paul Schumacker, my laboratory group has recently incorporated novel in vitro techniques to better understand specific cellular sources of oxidant stress during hyperoxic ventilation, which paradoxically is the most commonly used clinical treatment for respiratory failure and PPHN. Our work provides the scientific foundation for revising the current AHA recommendations to resuscitate critically ill newborns with 100% O2. I recently served as a lead investigator for a Phase I/II trial of intravenous sildenafil for the treatment of PPHN, and plan to proceed to a randomized multicenter clinical trial of intravenous sildenafil for infants with PPHN, beginning late in 2010.

1036557	Dr. Epsteins laboratory is engaged in the study of the impact of viral infections on the developing nervous system.  Currently we are investigating the role of Human Herpesvirus 6, and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) as potential causes of hippocampal injury during febrile status epilpepticus (FSE).  Dr. Epstein is a co-investigator and the study neurovirologist for the ten year NINDS funded multicenter longitudinal FEBSTAT study of  200 children with FSE.   To date we have found that HHV-6B is the most common cause of FSE in children accounting for nearly 30% of the infants that present with FSE.  This longitudinal study will allow us to determine if FSE caused by HHV-6B or HHV-7 is more likely to result in mesial temporal sclerosis and temporal lobe seizures.  Intractable temporal lobe seizures are the most common reason for epilepsy surgery in adolescents and young adults.   If  HHV-6B or HHV-7 prove to be responsible for hippocampal damage it is possible that the injury could be prevented by treatment with anti-viral or anti-infammatory medications at the time of presentation with FSE.

1039486	I have had a long-standing interest in studying RNA regulatory mechanisms in development.  My lab has focused on studying the mechanism of action of Evfs, novel long non-coding RNAs that regulate transcription factors essential for proper GABAergic interneuron development.  Although a critical role for developmentally regulated transcription factors in patterning and differentiation has been established for some time, the role of long, polyadenylated non-coding RNAs (lpncRNAs) is only beginning to be understood.  A handful of lpncRNAs play roles in X-inactivation, imprinting, and germ cell development, raising the question of whether lpncRNAs constitute a common or rare gene regulatory mechanism in the developing embryo.  We recently showed that the novel lpncRNA, Evf2 is conserved across vertebrates (ultraconserved), and is a sonic hedgehog target in the developing forebrain.  We also showed for the first time that the lpncRNA Evf2 complexes with the Dlx2 homeodomain transcription factor and regulates Dlx 5/6 enhancer activity in vitro (Feng et al. 2006).  Through analysis of an Evf2 loss-of-function mouse model developed in my lab, we now find that the Evf2ncRNA is not only required for proper regulation of genes in the Dlx 5/6 region, but also for proper GABAergic interneuron development in the embryonic brain and adult hippocampal circuitry (Bond et al. 2009).  This provides a novel mechanism in which a DNA regulatory element is regulated by a complementary lpncRNA critical for proper interneuron development. Future work focuses on the mechanism of Evf2-dependent interneuron loss and mechanisms involved in long ncRNA transcriptional control. In addition, the importance of GABA in orchestrating multiple developmental events and maintaining homeostasis in adult brain circuitry is leading us to test whether Evf2-mutants exhibit specific behavioral phenotypes.  Results support the idea that a single ncRNA controls a  complex behavior.

1040637	Anatomic Pathology, Neuropathology, Neuromuscular pathology<BR><BR> The early growth response (Egr) family of transcription factors are involved in cellular growth and differentiation and may play a role as initiation and propagation factors in some cancers. A major focus of our research is to understand the role of Egr transcription factors during development of the mammalian nervous system. We and others have discovered that these transcription factors regulate a variety of developmental processes including hindbrain organization, peripheral nerve myelination, sympathetic nervous system development, male and female fertility, induction of late phase long term potentiation (a form of synaptic plasticity) and muscle mechanoreceptor development. In the nervous system, Egr transcription factors are downstream signaling mediators of neuronal activity and growth factor molecules known as neurotrophins. We are actively exploring their role in mediating a variety of neurotrophin actions that include neurite outgrowth, synaptic vesicle protein regulation and muscle stretch receptor development. As plasticity related transcription factors, Egr genes are important for mediating nervous system adaptation to a variety of developmental and environmental stimuli. Egr transcription factors are also essential for some non-nervous system related developmental processes. For example, they are involved in monocyte and thymocyte development, and they are involved in growth and differentiation of pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma tumors. Using these model systems of differentiation, we are exploring the varied developmental pathways and target genes regulated by Egr transcription factors to elucidate their roles in cancer and developmental biology.

1041624	Our research closely links to the clinical problem of pressure induced soft tissue injury, commonly seen as the pressure sore in SCI individuals. To test our hypotheses that the mechanical properties are altered in wounded and denervated tissues, soft tissue samples (skin, fat, muscle) freshly collected from able-bodied, SCI individuals, and wounded tissues are being tested for compressive mechanical properties. Rat models of chronic SCI and pressure sore are being used to characterize the mechanical property change in vivo and ex vivo. A finite-element model for buttock-thigh has been developed specifically for the condition of sitting, is used as a tool to bridge the lab-acquired basic knowledge of the soft tissues and the clinical problems in reality. The effect of different sitting configuration on the buttock-thigh tissue loading, tissue perfusion, and skin temperature elevation are evaluated. We found that sitting greatly impeded tissue perfusion in buttock tissue and the pressure relief push-ups did not provide adequate recovery for tissue perfusion. Also, SCI individuals needed longer time for buttock tissue perfusion to recover after a long time sitting. We developed an Intelligent Automated Pressure Relief Seat  IAPRS which detects the seat-buttock contact and automatically relieves the buttock loading by lowering down the back part of the seat. IAPRS is being tested in clinical setting on SCI individuals and sitting related pressure sore. Preliminary results show that IAPRS promotes the pressure ulcer healing in sitting area, while maintaining the mobility for wheelchair users during the treatment of pressure ulcers. To test the feasibility of early detecting of pressure induced deep tissue injury under intact skin; an ultrasound tissue palpating probe (TUPS) has been adapted for in vivo testing of soft tissue gross stiffness on human subjects and on our animal models to differentiate injured from healthy tissue by detecting their stiffness difference

1042976	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the US, with a median survival time after diagnosis of less than 6 months and a 5-year disease-free survival of less than 5%. Pancreatic cancer is commonly associated with pronounced collagen-rich fibrotic reaction. We have found that there is significant cross-talk between type I collagen and the key proteinase membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) in regulating pancreatic cancer invasion. MT1-MMP is overexpressed in human pancreatic tumors particularly in areas of pronounced fibrosis. To better understand the role of MT1-MMP in vivo, we have created transgenic mice that can be targeted to express MT1-MMP in the pancreas, and have crossed these mice with mice expressing mutant KrasG12D. Excitingly, co-expression of human MMP-14 and K-rasG12D in the pancreas results in large, cystic, papillary lesions consistent with human intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Surprisingly, these lesions have very pronounced fibrotic reaction and are associated with increased TGF-ﬂ signaling and activation of stellate cells.  We have also been examining whether the interplay between collagen and MT1-MMP is involved in resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine chemotherapy. Recent reports have suggested that the fibrotic reaction limits the delivery and effectiveness of current therapies in pancreatic cancer. Consequently, my research group has been examining the extent to which type I collagen contributes to gemcitabine resistance. We have found that cells grown in 3D type I collagen are less likely to respond to gemcitabine compared to cells grown atop 3D collagen or on tissue culture plastic. Significantly, we have found that the effect is mediated in part via MT1-MMP. We are currently in the process of characterizing the detailed signaling pathways downstream of MT1-MMP that are involved in chemotherapy resistance in the 3D microenvironment.
1042976	The major focus of my lab is to understand the mechanisms utilized by invading and metastasizing tumor cells to promote expression and activity of extracellular matrix-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The lab currently has two projects. In our oral cancer project, we are interested in understanding how TGF-b1 signaling through Snail family of transcription factors increases MMPs and promotes invasion of oral cancer cells in 2D and 3D organotypic models of oral cancer. We have also established an orthotopic model for oral cancer wherein OSCC cells expressing GFP-tagged Snail or Slug are injected directly into the tongue to examine the role of these key proteins in promoting tumor growth and invasion in the in vivo microenvironment.  In addition to our work in oral cancer, we have also been examining the contribution of fibrosis to pancreatic cancer progression. Fibrosis, also known as desmoplastic reaction, is a very prominent feature of almost all human pancreatic tumors, and earlier reports suggested that this desmoplasia in fact contributed to pancreatic cancer progression. We recently published that the pancreatic cancer cells adjacent to areas of fibrosis exhibit increased expression of membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). We are particularly interested in understanding how the desmoplastic reaction increases the expression of MT1-MMP in the cancer cells, thus enabling the pancreatic cancer cells to invade through a collagen-rich extracellular matrix. In addition to utilizing in vitro models to examine the cross-talk between type I collagen and MT1-MMP, we have also established a transgenic mouse model in which MT1-MMP is selectively and under regulated conditions expressed in the pancreas to examine the effect of MT1-MMP on tumor growth and on the generation of desmoplastic reaction.

1043300	Clinical cancer/cancer health disparities research with focus on improving patient safety for older individuals with cancer. I am primarily engaged in active pharmacovigilance, including the detection and assessment of safety signals related to drugs and devices and the timely dissemination of findings to relevant stakeholders. A related research focus is comparative and cost effectiveness analyses of cancer related therapies targeted at older cancer patients and safe and cost-effective transitions of care for this cohort. I am also engaged in a collaborative NCI sponsored minority biobanking/biospecimen collection initiative with colleagues at several comprehensive cancer centers across the country. Future studies in pharmacogenomics are expected to aid in prescribing decisions and will likely predict older cancer patients who will respond appropriately to a given cancer-related medication or experience severe adverse drug reactions.
1043300	Serious adverse drug reactions in elderly cancer patients in the oncology setting are not being regularly identified, evaluated and reported.  When adverse events are reported for older cancer patients, the reports are often incomplete and hence causality assignment is delayed, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. A  clinically-based, hypothesis-driven approach to pharmacovigilance will improve the completeness of reporting and the assignment of causality, resulting in improved health outcomes for older cancer patients. In summary, I aim to 1) Identify, evaluate, and report on serious adverse reactions to drugs used in cancer patients age 65 and older;  2) Assess the completeness of adverse event reports for patients 65 years and older and  3) Assess both causality assignment and the timeliness of causality assignment in  patients <65 years with those >65 years

1045466	Our laboratory investigates the role of the nuclear factor Ikaros in T cell development and leukemogenesis. Ikaros is a nuclear factor that is a component of two chromatin remodeling complexes associated with gene activation as well as gene repression.  Genetically engineered Ikaros null mice develop T cell leukemia with 100% penetrance suggesting that Ikaros is a tumor suppressor.  In addition, lack of Ikaros results in multiple defects in T cell development that include a decrease in the number of T cells, an increased potential to differentiate into the CD4 lineage and a complete lack of fetal T cell development. In addition, they are unable to undergo negative selection, a checkpoint that is required to prevent the inappropriate maturation of autoreactive T cells.  In order to determine mechanisms for Ikaros role in T cell biology, we are studying the role of Ikaros in regulating Notch and TCR signaling pathways, as well as in regulating early developmental decisions from the level of early lymphoid progenitors.  We are also interested in investigating the role of Ikaros in regulation of T helper fate decisions during an immune response.  
1045574	I am interested in how early events and environments shape later outcomes of preterm births.  For example, babies who were small at birth seem to be at high risk for complications such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity in adulthood.  Why?  There are many theories, but a biological explanation is still missing.  I study prenatal environments such as maternal health, biological markers such as cord blood and placenta, and early neonatal experiences for clues as to and how they relate to later outcomes, especially obesity.  At present, I focus on outcomes during the neonatal period, but eventually I would like to follow growth and health of these babies into adulthood.

1048034	My lab studies the structure and function of ion channels, a family of membrane proteins that play many key roles in neuroscience and which are a major target of essential drugs used in clinical medicine. About a third of all genes in a typical genome code for membrane proteins, yet we know very little about their structure and function. Because ion movement across membranes can be measured with exquisite sensitivity, ion channels have always been at the vanguard of functional studies of membrane proteins, and as a consequence we have learned a great deal about how they function. Until recently, however, ion channels, like so many other membrane proteins, had proven very difficult to study at the structural level. The recent high-resolution description of several ion channels has opened up the field of structure-function in ion channels, and we are now in a position to ask detailed questions about how function is achieved through structure in this essential class of proteins. How do voltage-dependent ion channels sense the membrane potential? Through what structural rearrangements do these channels achieve voltage-dependent ion flow across the membrane? How can highly dynamic proteins maintain such outstanding control of what sorts of ions are allowed to pass? These are some of the questions that we attempt to answer.

1048574	The laboratory is interested in determining the role of intermediate filament proteins (IF) in prostate cancer. There are two main goals. First, can the development and progression of prostate cancer and patient outcome be determined be determined by the IF expression profile. This hypothesis is based on the observations that expression patterns of IF change when cells differentiate. Second, does the organization of nuclear lamins in prostate cancer cells affect DNA replication and transcription. We have previously determined that lamins directly bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen and expression of dominant negative mutant lamins affects DNA replication. Furthermore, we have shown that lamin expression affects RNA Pol II transcription. Nuclear microdomains can also influence the transcription potential of chromosomes in the region.

1048762	Cells contact and communicate with their neighbors via specialized cell surface receptors.  This intimate exchange of information controls morphogenetic events during embryonic development and maintains tissue organization in adults.  Birth defects and cancer commonly result when cells fail to recognize and respond appropriately to their environment.  The work in my laboratory is guided by the hypothesis that epithelial cells receive and interpret contextual information through the coordination of adhesion and signaling receptor systems present on the cell surface.  To test this idea, we manipulate the ability of epithelial cells to interact with one another and measure their capacity to transduce intracellular signals that regulate cell fate and behavior.  In parallel, we assess the potential of cell surface signaling receptors to alter the manner in which epithelial cells adhere to their partners.  A three-dimensional in vitro model of the human epidermis is used to help define these adhesion-signaling networks during epithelial tissue morphogenesis.

1050302	Our laboratory studies the neuroinvasive herpesviruses with a focus on the molecular mechanisms by which these pathogens propagate and disseminate within the nervous system. The outcome of infection is closely tied to the route the viruses spread within the nervous system, with outcomes typically relative benign but sometimes producing blindness and lethal encephalitis. We use a combination of live-cell fluorescence microscopy, molecular genetics and neuronal cell biology to examine the dynamics of viral particle assembly and intracellular axon transport. These molecular mechanisms are then examined in the larger context of neuroinvasion and pathogenesis. Two long-term goals of our research are to identify novel targets in the viral infectious cycle for development of antivirals, and engineering recombinant viral particles as effective gene delivery vehicles.

1050787	The principal focus of this laboratory is the examination of the spatial and temporal patterns of motor cortical activity preceding voluntary movement and the function of this activity in shaping and controlling movement initiation.  In particular we are interested in the function of the primary and supplementary motor areas and their interactions with the basal-ganglia in the feedforward and feedback control of movement.  We use a variety of non-invasive techniques to assess these systems in humans such as:  high-resolution EEG recordings and MRI-based source reconstruction techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, multi-channel EMG, and measures of movement kinematics and kinetics.  Experiments are currently being conducted to examine the role of the primary and supplementary motor areas and brainstem in the preparation and release of voluntary movements. Neurological diseases that affect the basal ganglia have a significant impact upon the function of the primary and supplementary motor areas.  For this reason, our research is also focused on the assessment of motor cortical function in neurological disorders such as Parkinsons disease and dystonia.  This work is conducted in collaboration with The Parkinsons Disease and Movement Disorders Center at Northwestern.  We are currently examining the control of repetitive movements in patients with Parkinsons disease and the effects of dopaminergic replacement therapy and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (a neurosurgical treatment for advanced Parkinsons disease) on the control of these movements.

1051269	Brain functions are the result of the coordinated activity of large networks of neurons, which are composed by many different cell types. As a consequence, the specific properties of synaptic communication between different types of neurons play a pivotal role in shaping the computational power and network activity of specific brain regions. Research in my laboratory is focused on the hippocampus, which is an area of the brain involved in higher cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, and is often affected by important neurological illnesses like epilepsy, schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease. In particular, we are interested in the synaptic properties of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, which are a very heterogeneous cellular population, with wide anatomical and functional diversity. Additionally we are trying to unravel the network properties of Cajal-Retzius cells, which are a neuronal population involved in guiding cortical development, whose computational functions remain poorly understood. Methodologically, we use state-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques in vitro such as paired recordings from anatomically identified connected neurons and optogenetic control of specific cellular populations. We hope that relating different neuronal types to clear network functions may lead to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of hippocampal activity, and generate important insight into the organizing principles of cortical networks in the normal brain and during disease.

In addition to sharing these data and materials with the radiobiological community, my group is investigating the archive as well; we are applying new statistical approaches on old datasets and new experimental approaches for investigation of formalin fixed and paraffin embedded materials. Work with micro-RNA microarrays, and use of X-ray fluorescence microscopy for histopathological analysis fall into this research. Work in bionanotechnology includes development and investigation of multifunctional nanoconstructs, increasing contrast for biomedical imaging (MRI and CT), enabling delivery of small molecules (such as chemotherapeutic drugs, flavonoids etc.) and producing cytotoxic reactive oxygen species to fortify effect of radiotherapy.

1051485	We study how stem cell division and differentiation are coordinated.  Cell division and differentiation are in many ways mutually exclusive. Most cells stop dividing as they adopt a specific fate, while relatively undifferentiated stem cells are able to divide throughout the lifetime of the organism. Cancer cells are characterized by both poorly controlled proliferation and a loss of the differentiated phenotype. During regeneration, quiescent differentiated cells revert to a stem cell phenotype and begin dividing anew.  Our research focuses on hematopoietic stem cells, germline stem cells, and myocardial stem cells.  Our central approach is to construct knockout mouse models to study proteins that regulate stem cell division and differentiation patterns.  We also study the mechanism of nuclear reprogramming using Xenopus eggs.

1051610	The research interests of my group are in the field of cytokine-signaling in malignant cells.  We have previously identified and characterized several novel signaling cascades activated by the Type I interferon receptor downstream of Jak-kinases in leukemia and other neoplastic cells, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-pathway, the Crk-pathway and the p38 Map kinase signaling cascade.  These studies have been expanded in efforts to determine the mechanisms by which chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells become refractory to the antiproliferative effect of interferons and the mechanisms of synergy between interferon and STI571 (Gleevec) in CML cells.  We have also recently identified the kinase that mediates phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727 as the protein kinase C-delta (PKC&#61540;).   Other research areas in which our laboratory is actively engaged are the mechanisms of signal transduction of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia.  We have recently shown that ATRA activates the Rac1/p38 Map kinase pathway and that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway enhances its effects on leukemia cells, raising the prospect of development of translational studies combining ATRA with pharmacological inhibitors of Map kinases for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.  Finally, our group also studies the signaling mechanisms of regulation of normal hematopoiesis by myelosuppressive cytokines, including interferons, tumor necrosis factor-alfa and transforming growth factor-beta.

1051734	The laboratory has a long standing interest in the biology of epithelial stem cells. To this end, in collaboration with Tung-Tien Sun (NYU Medical School) we have identified and characterized epithelial stem cells of the epidermis, corneal epithelium and hair follicle       Another research focus of the laboratory is the characterization of epithelial-enriched  microRNAs (miRNAs) to understand how these miRNAs regulate epithelial stem cell behavior and epithelial differentiation. We have demonstrated the presence of several miRNAs that are specifically localized in the corneal epithelium of adult mice; other miRNAs are found in many stratified squamous epithelia including the epidermis. Recently we have found that the lipid phosphatase SHIP2 is a target for miRNA- 205 (miR-205), which is expressed in many stratified squamous epithelia. We have also found that miR-184, which is exclusively found in the corneal epithelium, antagonizes miR-205 to help maintain the levels of SHIP2. This is the first example of a miRNA negatively regulating another to maintain levels of a target protein. 
1051743	My current research interests include radiation biology and nanotechnology and development of a new instrument for high resolution microscopy--Bionanoprobe.  In the field of radiation biology, my primary focus is on mechanisms underlying development of genomic instability caused by ionizing  irradiation. This investigation includes work with cells in culture and animal models as well as exploration of archival animal tissues collected from large scale animal experiments, currently located in Woloschak laboratory. My efforts in the field of biomedical nanotechnology include development and investigation of nanoconstructs suitable for biomedical imaging and cancer therapy. Different metals and metal oxides are combined to form the compact center of nanocomposites; their outer layer(s) are made by conjugation of biomolecules and small molecules which enable nanoconstruct targeting and use in vitro and in vivo.  Study of interactions between nanoconstructs and cells and tissues requires high throughput and high resolution imaging that co-registers both biological material and nanoconstructs. Only technique that can fulfill all of these requirements is X-ray fluorescence microscopy. A grant awarded to our laboratory was used for custom construction of unique new instrument--Bionanoprobe. This instrument is now installed at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron and will be used for imaging for bio-nanotechnology.

1052335	Dr. Farrow's research focuses on the tissue-specific and developmental regulation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the pulmonary vasculature, both in normal transition after birth, as well as in the context of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Dr. Farrows laboratory has demonstrated that exposure to high levels of oxygen, which is a common treatment for both PPHN and BPD, leads to increased PDE5 expression and activity in the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle of neonatal sheep and mice. This increased PDE5 expression and activity leads to decreased pulmonary vascular relaxation in response to nitric oxide, a common pulmonary vasodilator.  In the future, new drugs such as PDE5 inhibitors or anti-oxidants may play an important role in the treatment of infants with PPHN or BPD.
1052350	Dr. Bakers research has focused on access to health care, racial and ethnic disparities in care, health communication, and interventions to improve quality of care for chronic diseases.  In the area of access to care and health care delivery for vulnerable populations, his interests include health literacy, language barriers, the effect of lack of insurance on health care use and health outcomes, and racial and ethnic differences in health care use and outcomes.  He has led studies examining many aspects of quality, including whether hospital mortality report cards lead to changes in market share for hospitals and improvements in outcomes, the effect of disease management programs for patients with heart failure, and the effectiveness of learning collaboratives.  His current work is examining quality measurement and quality improvement using electronic health record systems.
1052350	My research has focused on access to health care, racial and ethnic disparities in care, health communication (including health literacy and language as barriers to care), and quality of care for chronic diseases.

1052351	My current research efforts employ several innovative methods for quantifying multi-joint upper extremity movement control during both postural and movement tasks in individuals with stroke. I utilize the same quantitative methods to instrument direct impairment-targeted interventions in an effort to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying impaired movement and subsequent restoration of normal movement in individuals with stroke. This research is in collaboration with Julius P.A. Dewald, PT, PhD and is further augmented by collaborations with colleagues with expertise in neural imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. I also specialize in the training of Physical and Occupational Therapists in the administration of impairment, activity, and participation limitation assessments for individuals with stroke and the subsequent processes necessary for standardized delivery of assessments in clinical trials. Through my clinical research efforts I hope to contribute to the evolution of rehabilitation medicine and science by advancing neurological rehabilitation principles and techniques. The key component most likely to impact rehabilitation in this magnitude is the elucidation of the neurological underpinnings responsible for movement discoordination and through the subsequent development of more effective rehabilitation therapies for individuals with functionally debilitating movement impairments. 
1052368	Blood Bank   Hemostasis-Coagulation<BR><BR> Our laboratory focuses on the mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant sites in the body, leading to prostate cancer morbidity and death. We have characterized prostate cancer cell lines and found that the ras homolog RhoA and the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB are active and necessary for highly invasive prostate cancer cell behavior. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may promote tumor progression and stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis. We have found that co-cultures with monocyte-derived THP-1 and U-937 cells or peripheral blood monocytes stimulated PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell basement membrane invasion. The monocyte-derived cells also stimulate prostate cancer cell NF-kappaB activity.  Prostate cancer cell invasion and NF-kappaB activity in the co-cultures is inhibited by dominant negative I-kappaBalpha transfection or treatment with biochemical NF-kappaB inhibitors. These studies provide evidence that human monocyte-derived cells cross-communicate with prostate cancer cells and stimulate cancer cell invasion requiring cancer cell NF-kappaB activity. This model has the potential to identify treatments that may target the effect of monocyte-derived cells on cancer cell invasion and progression.  By identifying the mediators of prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis, we hope to discover critical steps of cancer cell invasion and metastasis and find targeted strategies to block malignant prostate cancer progression.

1052813	developmental neurobiology molecular diagnostics clinical pathology Research Interests <BR> <BR> Our major research interest is understanding the factors that control cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing mammalian central nervous system. Although the mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation during neural development are poorly understood, studies in other tissues suggest that loss of normal cell polarity and tissue architecture play crucial regulatory roles in cell proliferation and cancer. Our most recent work suggests that beta catenin, an integral component of the adherens junction, can regulate cell cycle re-entry and differentiation in the developing mammalian brain. Transgenic mice expressing a truncated, stabilized form of beta catenin develop massively enlarged brains with increased cerebral cortical surface area and folds resembling sulci and gyri of higher mammals. Understanding the biology of epithelial organization can lend insight onto the regulation of proliferation during neural development and ultimately reveal mechanisms underlying developmental brain disorders and tumors in the central nervous system.

1053088	As many as 20% of breast cancer patients have brain metastases, with women surviving only 2-16 months after diagnosis of this metastasis. Thus, resolving the mechanisms of metastasis to the brain is clinically important. In invasive breast carcinomas, Syndecan (Sdc) 1 is observed in stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells where it is involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Staining for Sdc1 in both the tumor and stromal cells has been reported to be a negative predictor of disease free and overall survival in estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast tumors, and expression of Sdc1 and 4 is associated with increased proliferation index in breast tumors. A direct connection between these receptors and breast cancer metastasis has not been shown. The reduced expression of Sdc1 or 4 in MDA-231 breast cancer cells and reduced expression of Sdc4 in CN34Brm breast cancer cells significantly decreased metastases to only the brain but had no effect on bone, lung, or ovarian metastases when the cells were injected into the left ventricle of the mouse heart (nude mice). Additionally, metastases to the brain was reduced when these cells were injected in the orthotopic site of NSG mice, however, primary tumor growth and metastases to the lung, liver, ovaries, and lymph nodes were not affected in this model. These results suggest Sdc1 and 4 facilitate breast cancer organotropism to the brain. We are currently examining the mechanism of how Sdc1 and 4 affects breast cancer organotorpism to the brain. These results may explain the correlative observations of Sdc expression with poor clinical outcome. These studies may lead to development of new biomarkers and/or treatment for breast cancer metastasis to the brain.

1053369	Our research is focused on issues of immune regulation. A long-standing effort has been to understand the how IL-4 is regulated in T and mast cells. We have identified that Ikaros, a transcription factor that regulates chromatin conformation, has distinct cell-type specific effects on the IL-4 gene locus in these cells. We are trying to understand the underlying mechanism of this unique repression of transcription in mast cells and activation of transcription in T cells. Another major project involves the study of mast cells in the autoimmune diseases MS and type 1 diabetes. Althoug well-established mediators of allergic responses, mast cells are potent sources of many immunomodulatory molecules cells that can modulate disease course. Using mast cell-deficient mice, we have established that mast cells are required for fulminant EAE (MS) and NOD mouse diabetes. We are investigating the mechanism of action of these cells in disease pathogenesis.

1054860	The laboratory research of Serdar E. Bulun, MD, focuses on studying estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, in particular aromatase expression, in hormone-dependent human diseases such as breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. A team of investigators works on understanding the epitheial-stromal interactions and aromotase overexpression in breast cancer tissue. Since aromatase inhibitors treat breast tumors primarily via suppressing intratumoral estrogen biosynthesis, these efforts are important for discovering new targets of treatment. Another team studies endometriosis. Basic data from this laboratory led to the introduction of aromatase inhibitors into endometriosis treatment. Human tissues and a primate model are used to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of endometriosis. Regulation of aromatase expression is also studied in uterine fibroids, benign tumors that are dependent on estrogen for growth, by a third team. A fourth team is investigating the link between progesterone action and estrogen inactivation in normal endometrium and endometriosis. Lastly, a fifth team has identified novel mutations that cause familial excessive estrogen formation syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, gynecomastia, and hypogandism in males and early breast development and irregular menses in females. In this syndrome, heterozygous inversions in chromosome 15q21, which cause the coding region of the aromatase gene to lie adjacent to constitutively active cryptic promoters that normally transcribe other genes, result in estrogen excess owing to the overexpression of aromatase in many tissues.

1055047	Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental illness, which affects 1% of the population and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.  We focus our research on the cellular mechanisms by which DISC1, a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, affects neurodevelopment. DISC1 was initially identified in a large Scottish family with members who suffered from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression. DISC1s association with schizophrenia has been confirmed in other population and family studies. Genetic studies have also indicated a DISC1 association with bipolar affective disorder and with autism and Asperger syndrome. Understanding the genetic and developmental basis of schizophrenia is critical for discovering treatments.  Two recent publications by the Morris laboratory focus on the role of Disc1 in development, particularly the migration of cells to their proper location in the brain and subsequent differentiation into their intended fate.
1055048	My lab studies the processes that regulate the early development of the embryo, including cell movements, survival, proliferation, and differentiation.  We focus on a number of proteins which are linked to human birth defects, to try to understand these abnormalities.  In order to observe changes in cells and gene expression, we model human birth defects in both chicken and zebrafish embryos.  This combination of systems allows us to have rapid interrogation of developing embryos as well as large supplies of tissues for comparative studies.  We focus on the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays multiple roles in establishing cell fates, as well as regulating cell numbers by controlling both proliferation and survival.Current studies in my lab include exploring the gene expression changes produced by embryonic exposure to ethanol, and developing novel therapeutics that can restore normal development without causing harm to non-affected embryos.

1055592	My broad research interest lies in understanding the molecular basis of human genetic diseases and developing therapeutics for their treatment. Specifically, my research primarily focuses on neuromuscular diseases, which are those that affect muscle, the nerves that innervate muscle or the neuromuscular junction, which is the connection between the two. One way to approach this problem is to study mutations that disrupt normal neural development. Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a prime example. After cystic fibrosis, SMA is the most common autosomal recessive childhood disease. The disease affects 1/10,000 live born children. It is characterized by degeneration of the a-motor neurons in the spinal cord, which causes proximal, symmetrical limb and trunk muscle weakness that progresses to paralysis and ultimately death. Currently, there is no available treatment for SMA patients.  Mutations in survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene are responsible for SMA. In humans, two virtually identical copies of SMN are present, SMN1 and SMN2. SMN1 produces only full-length transcripts (FL-SMN) and is therefore the SMA-determining gene, whereas the predominant transcript from SMN2 is an exon 7 alternatively spliced form. The SMN2 gene also produces a low level of FL-SMN transcript, which explains why SMA is not embryonic lethal in humans. Nevertheless, lower motor neurons eventually succumb to the reduced SMN dosage and degenerate. Why motor neurons are specifically affected is not clear but it has been proposed that this may be due to a distinct role for SMN in this cell type.  We have developed a translational research program for SMA. The research is multi-faceted and uses biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, and animal modeling. We use these approaches to decipher SMN function within nerve and muscle, the two tissues affected in SMA. We have also generated a hypomorphic allelic series of Smn mutations in mice that mimic human SMN2 splicing.
1055613	Kinesin motors drive intracellular transport of many different cargoes along microtubules, and they are critical to trafficking in the nervous system as well as cell division.  Antimitotic drugs that act on two kinesin motors, Eg5 and CENP-E, are currently in phase I and II clinical trials.  Several kinesin motors, including Eg5 and CENP-E, are intrinsically regulated in the cell by their C-terminal tail domains. Our laboratory's work is inspired by the fact that there appear to be multiple, highly effective mechanisms that nature has developed for regulating kinesin kinesin motors. Our hope is that once we understand these natural regulation mechanisms, they can be mimicked to develop new and better antimitotic drugs, resulting ultimately in a larger number of treatment options.
1055648	SYNAPTIC STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY: FROM MOLECULES TO  COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AND DISEASE Research in my lab centers on signal transduction networks that regulate the structural and functional plasticity of excitatory synapses. Synaptic communication between neurons within brain circuits underlies cognitive functions, and is disrupted in numerous neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Most central excitatory synapses are located on dendritic spines, and spine structure is essential for normal and pathological brain function. Spine dynamics is crucial for the establishment, maintenance, and experience dependent modification of connectivity in neural circuits. Conversely, abnormal dendritic spine morphology occurs in patients with neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimers disease. As spine morphology is closely associated with cognitive functions, understanding the mechanisms of regulation and dysregulation of spine plasticity is necessary to elucidate the neural bases of cognitive functions and disorders. The long-term goals of my research are: 1) to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms that control synaptic structural plasticity. 2) to determine how they influence the development, functioning, and plasticity of brain circuits underlying cognition. 3) to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic pathology and determine their impact on disease endophenotypes. To to achieve these objectives, we employ a multidisciplinary array of molecular, cellular, imaging, transgenic, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches, and have assembled an outstanding team of collaborators.

Currently, I am conducting two large ancillary studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Arthritis Foundation.  In those studies, I am examining autoantibodies as risk factors for subclinical atherosclerosis and clinical cardiovascular outcomes in two large general population cohorts, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study  and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).  I am interested in this area of research because there is a well-established association between coronary heart disease and autoimmune rheumatic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, but the exact cause is not known. In addition, I am also examining the influence of race and gender on rheumatic disease related autoantibodies in the CARDIA and MESA participants in order to better understand risk factors for rheumatic disease development.

1056697	Dr. Schleimer has a longstanding interest in the mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids in allergic diseases.  Past studies have ranged from translational investigations in human subjects to molecular biological assessment of glucocorticoid action.  Mechanisms of the pathogenesis of allergic diseases including asthma, rhinosinusitis, dermatitis and others have also been an area of investigation.  Recent studies have focused on the role of airway epithelial cells as integrators of responses in the airways, including inflammation, innate immunity and adaptive immunity.

1056845	My lab is interested in how cell-cell adhesion and differentiation are controlled and coordinated by the multifunctional protein, beta catenin. In particular, we are interested in how the signaling form of beta catenin becomes activated, and how phosphorylation modulates beta catenin's various functions.  Molecular insights into the fine regulation of beta catenin signaling and adhesion will be relevant to pulmonary fibrosis and cancers.
1056845	My research centers on understanding mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion, and how adhesive information is conveyed to the cell's interior.  We focus on the cytoplasmic protein, b-catenin, which plays essential roles in both intercellular adhesion and nuclear signaling.  At the cell surface, b-catenin binds the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin-type adhesion receptors, which allows cells to engage their neighbors through robust intercellular adhering junctions.   In the cytoplasm and nucleus, a cadherin-independent pool of b-catenin transduces extracellular Wnt signals by interacting with TCF-type transcription factors to activate target genes. The Wnt/b-catenin signaling cascade activates genes that allow cells to adopt particular identities throughout development.  In adult tissues, activation of this pathway maintains the 'progenitor' phenotype, while inhibition of this pathway promotes differentiation.  In the lung alveolus, type 2 epithelial cells are thought to give rise to type 1 cells, but the signaling mechanisms which drive this process remain poorly defined.  We reason that modulation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling controls type 2 differentiation into type 1 cells, and experiments are currently underway to address this hypothesis.  Defining the signaling pathways that control AT2 maintenance and differentiation may aid our understanding of the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis and COPD. 
1056853	Richard C. Meagher, Ph.D. is Associate Research Professor in the Division of Hematology/Onocology and Director of the Cell Therapy Processing Facility at the Feinberg School of Medicine.  Dr. Meagher‚¨'s primary research interests include the role of the hematopoietic microenvironment (stroma) on the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of stem cell progenitors and precursors, especially the role it plays in directing the immune arm of the hematopoeitic system.  In addition, Dr. Meagher has studied the mechanisms of action of hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines and the control they exert on stem cell precursors.  These interests have led him to develop novel translational methods and procedures for the collection and long-term cryopreservation of human stem cell sources including bone marrow, peripheral blood progenitors and umbilical cord blood cells.  He is currently investigating novel replacement agents for dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that is considered the gold standard for cryopreservation of human blood products intended for clinical transplantation.

1057063	The innovation of pediatric specialty clinicians has extended the lives of children with complex medical needs, neurological impairment, and technology dependence.  However, our systems of care have difficulty meeting the complex needs of this emerging population.  Challenges lie in coordination of care through a vast continuum that includes hospital systems, primary care, home health, etc.  My interests lie in defining this population of patients; studying their needs on a clinical and systems level, and advocating for quality improvement.  A new area of focus is the potential for electronic health information exchange, now a national priority, to facilitate the coordination of care for these patients.

1057261	Dr. Podojils work has focused on the role of costimulatory molecule expression and function on both CD4+ T cells and APC populations during autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and he has a particular interest in neuroimmunology.  His primary research focus is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the differential effect of structurally modified forms of anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the CD4+ Th1 cell mediated disease model of PLP139-151-induced EAE. His current findings suggest that stimulation of CD80 on a CD4+ T cell activated in Th1-promoting conditions induces an increase in the amount of IFN-ø produced per cell and increases Th1 cell survival within the CNS.  These findings suggesting a mechanism by which anti-CD80 mAb treatment of PLP139-151-primed mice exacerbates disease, while treatment with anti-CD80 Fab fragments decrease disease severity.  In line with his research studying the role of CD80 expression and reverse signaling to the cell expressing CD80, he has also been studying the role of B7-H4 in CD4+ T cell function.  B7-H4 is a recently discovered B7-family member molecule hypothesized to inhibit effector CD4+ T cell responses.  Since current approaches for regulation of human autoimmune diseases are largely broad-based immunosuppressive strategies necessitating the physical deletion/inhibition of entire subsets of T cells or non-specific inhibition of antigen presentation or pro-inflammatory cytokine production which could compromise the hosts ability to combat opportunistic pathogens and/or increase risk of neoplasia, therefore we are currently investing the ability of short-term therapy with B7-H4 Ig may prove to be clinically viable.

1057699	The focus of research in my laboratory is to understand the immune basis of prostate disease in humans. We have a particular emphasis on chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), a debilitating medical condition characterized by dysuria and pelvic pain.  My laboratory is very interested in understanding the mechanism underlying inflammation of the human prostate and it's impact on prostate diseases. The laboratory utilizes comparative animal models that closely track human prostate disease to examine prostate disease mechanisms and also as tools for translational research. Some specific areas of research interest are as follows - 1. Th1/Th17 mechanisms in chronic pelvic pain: We are interested in understanding the mechanism of T cell mediated pain, the effectors of the pain pathway and measures to modulate Th1/Th17 immune response in animal models and ultimately in humans. 2. Chemokine mechanisms in chronic pelvic pain:We are in the process of identifying the mechanisms that appear to mediate chemokine mediated pelvic pain by focusing both on the prostate as well as on neuronal mechanisms of central sensitization. A further focus of this project is the role of mast cells and mast cell-released intermediates in the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain. Identification of biomarkers for CP/CPPS in humans is also an emphasis of this project. 3. Pattern recognition receptors in prostate inflammation: Deficiencies in TLR4 signaling pathways result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, and profound defects in innate and adaptive immunity. We are  in the process of studying the microbial pathogenesis of prostatic bacterial isolates and dissecting TLR signaling pathways in prostate cells.

1057770	Of the one million hospitalizations for acute heart failure (AHF) that occur every year, 80% are initially managed in the Emergency Department.  Despite tremendous advances in cardiovascular management, these patients have a very high post-discharge mortality and re-hospitalization rate, approaching 35% within 90 days.  The financial costs are also enormous, consuming more than half of the 40 billion spent annually on HF care.  Attempts to improve post-discharge outcomes with novel therapies have all failed, in  spite of 10 years of efforts.  Current therapeutic management in the ED is the same today as 40 years ago.   I firmly believe we can improve these dismal outcomes.   At Northwestern, it has been a tremendous privilege to have mentors/partners/and collaborators who are experts in Cardiology and Medicine both locally, nationally, and internationally to improve the care of AHF patients.  We are actively working to better understand the pathophysiology of early AHF in order to improve post-discharge outcomes for all AHF patients.  Through public/private partnerships, we are actively engaged in the discovery of novel therapies to help patients feel better and live longer.  Through both clinical research as well as quality improvement efforts, we hope to achieve our goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AHF.
1057792	Dr. Rahul Khare has recently received a K08 grant 'Improving Emergency Department (ED) Quality and Safety by Enhancing Operations and Quality Management' from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  For this five-year project Dr. Khare will focus on one key quality indicator score in the ED:  time-to-percutaneous intervention (PCI) quality indicator score for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Patients with STEMI have increased mortality if reperfusion or PCI is not achieved within 90 minutes.   Although there is an extensive literature about implementation of this process, the time-to-PCI quality indicator is achieved only 70% of the time.  Dr. Khare will develop and implement process improvements to address the most serious time-to PCI process concerns and  develop a toolkit, based on the findings that will assist hospitals and EDs in assessing opportunities for operational improvement and offer an approach for assessing and resolving quality management issues for time-to-PCI.

1057897	<BR><BR> Our laboratory is investigating the response of keratinocytes to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. We are investigating the role of JNK, p38 and ERK signal transduction pathways in response of cells to UV light and have recently demonstrated that JNK enzyme co-associates with p53 protein and p21Waf cyclin inhibitor. Other studies in the laboratory focus on development of novel chemopreventive agents against UV-induced skin cancer. Apigenin is a plant flavonoid which has been shown to inhibit UV- and chemically-induced mouse skin tumorigenesis and we believe it shows promise for development as a protective agent against human skin cancer. We have demonstrated that apigenin induces G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes and other cell lines by inhibiting both accumulation of cyclins and the cyclin dependent kinase activities of cdc2p34 and cdk2. We have also demonstrated that apigenin induces expression of the cell cycle inhibitor WAFp21 in a p53-dependent manner, and that the half-life of p53 protein is extended, due to stabilization via site-specific phosphorylation. Experiments are underway to characterize the kinase(s) involved in p53 phosphorylation. Our laboratory is also investigating the mechanisms by which apigenin inhibits UV-induction of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway, an enzyme important for prostaglandin production and cell transformation. Experiments are underway to characterize transcription factors which are involved in UV-induction of COX-2 and which may be modulated by apigenin treatment.

1058111	Our research focuses on fibrosis and tissue repair. Fibrosis and aberrant tissue repair are prominent in autoimmune diseases (scleroderma, myositis, lupus) and in organ-based disorders (pulmonary fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, hypertrophic scar), and are considered intractable. Aberrant tissue regeneration also underlie aging and obesity. Fibrosis contributes to 30% of all death worldwide, and thus represents a compelling and urgent scientific challegen. We believe that fibrosis is in fact potentially reversible. Our research takes a 'systems-biology' multi-disciplinary approach to fibrosis, utilizing human tissue, DNA, serum, and animal models and cell biology studies to identify and validate novel targets for therapy, discover genetic risk factors and useful biomarkers. we then attempt to translate these discoveries into clinically relevant approaches.
1058111	Our research focuses on the pathogenesis and treatment of fibrosis. We focus on the  interplay between vascular and autoimmune/inflammatory events in pathological fibrosis.

1058962	Research in our laboratory is focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Ca2+ is a ubiquitous intracellular signaling messenger, mediating many essential functions including gene expression, chemotaxis, and neurotransmitter release. Cellular Ca2+ signals generally arise from the opening of Ca2+ permeable ion channels, a diverse family of membrane proteins. We are studying Ca2+ signals arising from the opening of Store-Operated channels (SOCs), a family of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels activated by a decrease in the calcium content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Human patients with mutations in SOCs suffer from a devastating immunodeficiency, underscoring their vital importance for human immunity. We are studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which SOCs are activated and the mechanisms by which they regulate gene expression, immune cell function, and the development of neural stem cells.

From 1998 to 2002, Dr. Waypa was a postdoctoral fellow with Paul T. Schumacker, Ph.D. at The University of Chicago.  In 2002, Dr. Waypa received an appointment from The University of Chicago as a Research Associate (Assistant Professor) where he continued to work with Dr. Schumacker.  In 2004, Dr. Waypa received an appointment from Northwestern University as a Research Assistant Professor where he is continuing his collaboration with Dr. Schumacker.  Currently, Dr. Waypa is studying hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), which is a physiological response to low alveolar oxygen tension and, in cases where a small percentage of the lung alveoli are hypoxic, HPV improves lung gas exchange by redistributing blood flow away from those areas toward regions with better oxygenation.  Key to this research is understanding the mechanism of O2 sensing by the pulmonary vasculature and how this results in the generation of the HPV response.

1059844	Local synaptic circuits in motor-frontal cortex engage in neural operations underlying many aspects of cognition and behavior  motor control, executive functions, working memory, and more  yet circuit organization at the synaptic, cellular, and molecular levels remains poorly understood in this agranular cortex. What is the functional organization of these synaptic pathways? What cellular and circuit-level operations do neurons in these perform? How do these local circuits communicate with each other and how do they interact with subcortical systems in the basal ganglia and thalamus? The focus of our laboratory is to apply multiple tools of quantitative synaptic circuit analysis to elucidate the functional wiring diagrams of neocortical neurons in motor-frontal cortex. We use laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) microscopy, based on glutamate uncaging and channelrhodopsin-2 excitation, for rapid functional mapping of synaptic pathways onto single neurons in brain slices of motor-frontal cortex. We are also applying a variety of circuit analysis tools in efforts to identify circuit-level mechanisms in mouse models of disease, including autism, Rett syndrome, epilepsy, and motor neuron diseases.

1059913	Synaptic plasticity is the process by which the strength of communication between neurons is modulated in response to stimuli. This process has emerged as the strongest candidate mechanism underlying information storage and processing. In the cerebral cortex, the majority of excitatory synapses found on pyramidal neurons occur on dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are highly dynamic structures and undergo many forms of structural modification. Spine remodelling occurs in concert with changes in post-synaptic function, driven by the trafficking of synaptic glutamate receptors. Thus, structural plasticity is thought to control neural circuit refinement and information storage. Neuromodulators, including dopamine, noradrenaline and neurosteroids, can dramatically influence synaptic plasticity, but much less is known about mechanisms by which these modulators control structural plasticity. Aberrant structural plasticity and neuromodulatory signalling have been extensively associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders and mental retardation. Conversely, increased structural plasticity, and regulation of neuromodulatory signals, can promote functional recovery from neurological disorders. Thus, one of the most important challenges in neuroscience is to uncover the mechanisms underlying structural plasticity during brain development. My work is centered on understanding how neuromodulators and neurosteroids control structural plasticity and the mechanisms that underlie these effects.

1061090	ENDOTHELIAL CELL FUNCTION DURING ALLERGIC DISEASE. Leukocyte migration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation.   Specificity for the site of leukocyte migration is determined by the combination of adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines in the microenvironment.  We have focused on the function of the endothelial cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1.  VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelial cells during atherosclerosis, allograft rejection, infection, and asthmatic responses. Furthermore, disruption of the mouse VCAM-1 gene impairs placentation and cardiac development resulting in embryo death.  Thus, VCAM-1 has important functions in development and disease.  As little was known regarding VCAM-1 signaling, we studied the molecular mechanisms for VCAM-1 signal transduction in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Although it has traditionally been thought that VCAM-1 simply serves as a scaffold for leukocyte binding to endothelium, we have reported that it activates endothelial cell intracellular signal transduction pathways which result in endothelial cell shape changes and leukocyte passage. VCAM-1 activates endothelial cell NADPH oxidase resulting in the generation of low non-toxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  These ROS rapidly stimulate endothelial cell-associated  matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) which are required for VCAM-1-dependent lymphocyte migration. We have also demonstrated that in vivo administration of the antioxidant bilirubin blocks VCAM-1-dependent leukocyte migration into the lung in experimental asthma.  Currently, there are two main research directions.   1. We are examining mechanisms for VCAM-1-stimulated activation of endothelial cell NADPH oxidase, including studies of the structure/function of the cytoplasmic tail of VCAM-1.  We are also examining the mechanisms for ROS function in regulating endothelial cell intracellular signals. 2.  To further determine whether these VCAM-1 signals function in vivo, we are utilizing knockout and transgenic mouse models to examine VCAM-1-dependent infiltration of eosinophils in experimental asthma.  Pulmonary eosinophilia is one of the most consistent hallmarks of asthma.  Information about the mechanisms that control leukocyte infiltration will provide a basis towards proposing interventions in VCAM-1-mediated processes in disease.    Moreover, limiting VCAM-1 dependent inflammation in chronic disease may be an advantageous target as it could spare VCAM-1-independent inflammation such as neutrophil clearance of infections. 
1061090	LEUKOCYTE RECRUITMENT DURING ALLERGIC DISEASE.  White blood cell (leukocyte) migration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation.   Specificity for the site of leukocyte migration is determined by the combination of adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines in the microenvironment.  We have focused on regulation of allergic inflammation by vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1).  VCAM-1 is expressed on blood vessel endothelial cells during atherosclerosis, allograft rejection, infection, and asthmatic responses. Furthermore, disruption of the mouse VCAM-1 gene impairs heart development resulting in embryo death.  Thus, VCAM-1 has important functions in development and disease.   We are examining the molecular mechanisms for VCAM-1 signal transduction in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.  We have reported that VCAM-1 signals through reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide.  These reactive oxygen rapidly stimulate endothelial cell-associated  matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and protein kinase Ca, resulting in endothelial cell contraction for the opening of passageways through which leukocytes migrate.  Blocking this signaling pathway in vivo inhibits allergic inflammation. Currently, there are three main research directions regarding regulation of allergic inflammation.  1. Mechanisms for VCAM-1 signaling.   2. Vitamin E regulation of leukocyte recruitment in allergen responses. 3. Amino Acid (5HTP)/Neurotransmitter regulation of inflammation.

1063230	The research of the Economics of Movement group shows that movement and movement learning are similar in many respects. Our Sensors (Eyes, Ears, Skin etc) are not perfect but are noisy. Moreover, our muscles are noisy and if we try to do the same movement over and over it will be different each time. This means that if we make a movement, say swing a golf club, we will have uncertainty in the potential movement outcomes. Our group studies how people make movement decisions in the presence of such uncertainty. Our research has three main thrusts. (1)We study experimentally how people move and how their movements are affected by uncertainty. (2) We build computational models using Bayesian statistics to calculate how people could move optimally or learn to move optimally. (3) We build Bayesian Algorithms to solve problems that we find interesting. For example we analyze how neurons are connected in the nervous system. (4) We use mobile phone and gaming technology to improve rehabilitation and to improve diagnoses. The main thrust of our current research is to allow for better rehabilitation procedures through an understanding of motor learning.

My research projects focus on delivery of health care and patient outcomes. The large obstetric volume at Prentice Women's Hospital allows us to perform large, high-quality studies to answer important questions about pregnancy and delivery care.  We recently completed a large study looking at epistaxis (nose-bleeds) during pregnancy, and found that women with more nose bleeds were more likely to suffer excessive bleeding at delivery. n another project, we examined women with infections during labor (chorioamnionitis) to create a scoring system that allows us to predict which women will become septic. I am also interested in the social and psychological aspects of reproduction and childbearing,and just completed another project looking prospectively at obsessive-compulsive disorder in pregnancy and postpartum, which turns out to be unexpectedly common. I will next be creating a 'Global Assessment of the Postpartum Woman' to get a more comprehensive picture of the mental health challenges women face postpartum.
1063384	As a clinical psychologist, I direct NMFF's Women's Behavioral Health Clinic, which offers pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for women during pregnancy and postpartum phases.

1063665	Glucocorticoids are the most frequently prescribed medicine today and they are indispensable in the treatment of asthma, inflammation, and cancer.  However, two concerns regarding glucocorticoid use remain unresolved.  One is that high-dose or long-term glucocorticoids result in troublesome side effects such as metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis; the other is that some patients do not respond to glucocorticoids.   We tackle both questions by examining the glucocorticoid receptor.  Translational isoforms of glucocorticoid receptors were recently discovered in our lab and they provide insights into the mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids.  Ribosomal shunting and leaky scanning processes generate translational glucocorticoid receptor isoforms. These receptor isoforms have distinct cell-killing and cytokine-suppression capabilities in a bone cancer cell model system.  Currently, we are identifying and characterizing the receptor isoforms in different populations of immune cells in diseases such as asthma and cancer. This line of research has implications in several other fields in addition to immunology and oncology.  For instance, our findings in glucocorticoid receptor biology have significant impact on research in endocrinology as well.

1063829	My research focuses on the utilization of agent-based modeling for multi-scale modeling of acute inflammation. Agent levels include cells and molecules, with the goal of simulating organ- and organism-level behaviors from these generative mechanisms. While the focus of my models have primarily been on the pathophysiology of sepsis and multiple organ failure, in a more general sense I am interested in using agent-based modeling as a means of dynamic knowledge representation to augment the biomedical research process. With respect to acute inflammation, the ubiquitousness of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms suggest the application of this methodology to such area as oncogenesis, transplant immunology/rejection, autoimmune disease, wound healing/scarring, atherosclerosis and aging. I am currently using NetLogo as my primary agent-based modeling platform, but am involved with the development of SPARK (Simple Platform for Agent-based Representation of Knowledge http://www.pitt.edu/~cirm/spark/ ) currently being done at the University of Pittsburgh. I am also interested in automated text analysis/information extraction from biomedical texts, formal knowledge representation in biomedicine and the development of methods for evolving biomedical ontologies. These goals form a 'front-end' to high-level modeling tools (such as MetaABM http://www.metascapeabm.com/ ) and are intended to facilitate the ability for biomedical knowledge to be represented, communicated and evaluated via executable models. I am also involved in projects directed at developing methods to execute ABMs on massively parallel computing platforms. I believe this is a vital development necessary for true, multi-scale, biologically relevant simulation.

In addition, I am also interested in the immunopathogenesis of allergic diseases especially food allergy and the mechanisms involved in the development of tolerance to allergens.
1064580	The main focus of my research program is to study roles of tumor suppressors in normal development and in breast and prostate cancer progression, focusing on Maspin and an Ets transcription factor PDEF. Maspin is a unique member of SERPIN family that plays roles in normal tissue development, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis. Genetic studies by my laboratory using maspin transgenic and knockout mice demonstrated an important role of maspin in normal mammary, prostate, and embryonic development. Recently, we have identified several new properties of maspin. As a protein that is present on cell surface, maspin controls cell-ECM adhesion. This function is responsible for maspin-mediated suppression of tumor cell motility and invasion. We have also discovered that maspin is involved in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis through a mitochondrial death pathway. The long-term goals of these projects are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which maspin and PDEF control tumor metastasis and to identify their physiological functions in development.  Another focus of research in Zhang lab is to identify immune components that control breast cancer metastasis. Chronic inflammation not only increases neoplastic transformation but also drives the inhibition of the immune response in a protective negative-feedback mechanism. Suppressive immune cells are recruited to the sites of inflammation and function to inhibit both innate and adaptive immune responses, enabling tumor tolerance and unmitigated tumor progression. To study the interplay between tumor and immune cells, Zhang lab has developed a unique animal model of breast cancer that reproduces different stages of breast cancer bone metastasis. Molecules that control tumor-immune cell interaction and immunosuppression have been identified. We are currently studying roles of these genes in tumor-driven evolution that control chronic inflammation and immunosuppression.
1064642	Research interests  Dr. Hou was trained as a physician in China with several years of clinical experience in internal medicine.  Dr. Hous graduate training includes a Master of Medical Science degree in epidemiology and community medicine and a MD & PhD combined degree in molecular genetics in Japan. Dr. Hou further received her postdoctoral training in molecular cancer epidemiology in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  With a multidisciplinary background in medicine, basic science, and epidemiology, Dr. Hous research interest lies in integrating traditional epidemiologic methods with the ever-advancing molecular techniques in multi-disciplinary research focusing on identifying key molecular markers and understanding their potential impact on disease etiology, detection, and prevention.  Dr. Hous major research efforts to date have focused on two areas: 1) identification of risk factors that may cause chronic diseases; and 2) identification of biomarkers that serve as indicators of an individuals past exposure to disease risk factors and/or predict future disease risks and/or prognosis. The environmental/lifestyle risk factors that Dr. Hou has studied include air pollution, pesticides, overweight, physical inactivity, and reproductive factors in relation to chronic diseases.  The biomarkers that Dr. Hou has investigated include genetic factors (i.e., polymorphisms, telomere length shortening, mitochondria DNA copy number variations); and epigenetic factors (i.e., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA profiling).  Her over-arching research goal is to understand the biological mechanisms linking environmental risk factors with subclinical or clinical disease development, which ultimately lead to development of effective strategies for prevention of chronic diseases.
1064657	1. Mechanisms and physiology of Interleukin-10 mediated attenuation of cardiovascular injury and inflammation. These studies have an overall focus to understand the role of inflammation in exacerbating post-injury myocardial functions and tissue repair. The strategy involves utilizing IL-10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Past studies delineated the mechanisms by which IL-10 imparts its inhibitory action and showed that on molecular level, IL-10 acts mainly via post-transcriptional de-stabilization of mRNA half-life by suppressing mRNA stabilizing protein HuR which binds to mRNAs harboring specific A+U rich sequences in their 3 untranslated regions.  Current studies are expanded utilize IL-10 and its direct downstream target HuR, as potential therapeutic approaches to inhibit inflammation in post-myocardial infarction in animal models and to elucidate signaling pathways that govern IL-10 actions both in vitro and in vivo (Rajasingh et al, FASEB J, 2006; Krishnamurthy et al, Circ Res., 2009, Krishnamurthy et al., FASEB J, 2010). 2. Epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells to generate induced pluripotent cells and mechanisms of embryonic stem cell differentiation into cardiovascular linage cells. One component of this research focuses on to understand the molecular and signaling mechanisms governing directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (Rajasingh J et al, Circ. Res., 2007).  The second project in regenerative and stem cell biology that we have developed is to epigenetically reprogram adult somatic cells into ES-like cells (iPS cells) by utilizing cell-free ES cell protein extracts thereby bypassing the use of retroviral mediated forced expression of exogeneous transgenes (Rajasingh J et al, Circ Res., 2008). Studies are ongoing to address the mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming and to define the role of critical epigenetic factors required for this transition.
1064657	CURRENT RESEARCH INTERESTS 1 )  To understand molecular mechanisms and signal transduction involved in the inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha)-induced dysfunction of endothelial cells (EC) in cell culture model system and the mechanisms of cytokine regulation on the healing of endothelium in vivo in moue models of carotid artery denudation (equivalent to balloon angioplasty in patients). We have established that locally secreted TNF acts to inhibit endothelial recovery leading to restenosis, partly via inducing cell cycle arrest in ECs (Kishore, Circulation Research 2002, 2003; JCI, 2005),although complete molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways involved therein are yet to be deciphered. Understanding of EC gene regulation may potentially help finding target molecules whose modulation can nullify deleterious effects of TNF. Another component of this project involves elucidating trans-factors involved in posttranscriptional (mRNA stability) regulation of TNF by anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Rajasingh, Kishore, FASEB J, 2006). 2)  To understand the molecular and signaling mechanisms governing directed differentiation of mouse embryonic (Rajasingh, Circulation Research; 2007) and adult stem cells and oocyte-independent means for the de-differentiation of adult somatic cells to generate stem-like cells and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of these cells towards tissue repair in mouse models of surgically induced myocardial infarction and other ischemic injuries. 3) To study and understand the role of long-term alcohol consumption (chronic alcoholism) on cardiovascular system. Chronic ethanol inhibits cell survival signaling by various mechanisms, including but not limited to the enhanced release of TNF and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our studies indicate that in vitro chronic ethanol exposure exerts inhibitory effects on EC proliferation and survival (Luedemann, Kishore, Alco Clin Exp Res, 2005; Rajasingh, Kishore, Endocrinology, 2007). Chronic ethanol not only elevates agonist-induced TNF expression in EC but also exacerbates TNF-mediated EC dysfunction, synergistically. Our current studies are focused toward understanding the biology of ethanol-induced EC dysfunction in ethanol-fed rodent models as wells as towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms in cell culture model system.

This includes the development of sophisticated monitoring techniques to detect the immune status of the recipient and the appearance of these regulatory cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and transplanted organ in the recipient.   I am currently conducting a clinical trial at Northwestern in 20 such HLA-identical living donor kidney transplant recipients of donor stem cells, along with the transplanted organ, and following the recipient for the detection of these immune regulatory functions.
1065729	My lab studies the inflammatory response at the cellular and molecular level.  We are focused on the process of diapedesis, the 'point of no return' in inflammation where leukocytes squeeze between tightly apposed endothelial cells to enter the site of inflammation.  We have identified and cloned several molecules that are critical to the process of diapedesis (PECAM (CD31), CD99, and VE-cadherin) and are studying how they regulate the inflammatory response using in vitro and in vivo models.  We have recently described the Lateral Border Recycling Compartment, a novel para-junctional organelle that contains PECAM and CD99 and is critical for diapedesis to occur. We are currently investigating how this compartment regulates diapedesis in the hope of finding novel targets for anti-inflammatory therapy.

1066072	1.Patients with diabetes and obesity have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. These metabolic conditions are associated with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance leading to severe coronary events and worse clinical outcomes. The long-term goal of our research is to determine mechanisms by which diabetes/obesity increase risk for coronary artery disease and the resulting pathophysiological consequences. In this context, macrophages (part of the innate immune system) have emerged as a key pathogenic link between diabetes/obesity and the resulting coronary artery disease. Macrophages play critical role in regulating the body's inflammatory response to environmental stimuli, pathogen recognition, clearing cellular debris and inflammatory cytokine secretion. However, their chronic activation in diabetes/obesity might induce endothelial dysfunction, cardiac cell death, extracellular matrix remodeling and contractile dysfunction leading to heart failure. Our research efforts are focused on understanding the cellular and molecular connections between macrophage biology, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance, and diabetes/obesity-induced cardiovascular disease. These studies will facilitate development of novel therapies that specifically target recruited macrophages to treat the underlying inflammation and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes/obesity. 2. Acute ischemic injury and chronic cardiomyopathies lead to permanent loss of cardiac tissue. Transplantation of bonemarrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells has the potential to improve cardiac function after ischemic injury. However, number and functional capacity of these cells are impaired in diabetes. Our objectives are to determine the impact of the diabetic milieu (high glucose and fatty acids) on progenitor cell biology and function and their contribution to myocardial repair in response to ischemic injury.
1066075	My research for the past 20 years has been in the areas of immune responsiveness and tolerance induction in clinical organ transplantation.  These studies have resulted in more than 200 publications including book chapters, review articles and editorials, original papers and presentations.  The major thrust of these has been on the immunological effects of donor bone marrow cell (DBMC) and donor hematopoetic stem cell (DHSC) infusions in organ transplant patients using in vitro and ex vivo culture systems. It has been observed that using multiple assays for donor specific unresponsiveness may identify potentially tolerant recipients who may be candidates for immunosuppressive drug (IS) withdrawal. Recent studies have also assessed the role of CD4+CD25High FoxP3+ regulatory T cells as potential tolerance inducers in kidney and liver transplant patients, as well as the differential susceptibility these cells to various immunosuppressive drugs used in clinical transplantation.

1066664	Primary research interests are in the applications of minimally invasive surgery to spine.  Secondary research interest is in stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury. 
1066665	My laboratory explores the cell surface as a dynamic platform regulating cell behavior.  Specifically, we seek to understand how surface glycoproteins regulate cell-cell fusion in muscle cells, and to determine how pathogens target cardiac muscle.  Using surface modification, we then hope to re-engineer stem cells to improve tissue targeting and tissue integration.  To accomplish these broad aims, our current research projects are exploring the following research issues:  (1) Tissue tropism of Trypanosoma cruzi.  T. cruzi demonstrates tissue tropism during both the acute and chronic phases of infection, targeting cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle.  Patients with chronic T. cruzi infection may develop clinical symptoms related to target tissue infection, notably myositis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and megasyndromes.  The molecular basis for these clinical observations is incompletely understood.  My research hopes to define and characterize the cell surface proteins important during the initial host-parasite interaction enabling myogenic specificity.  (2) Drug discovery for African Trypanosomiasis. T. brucei behaves as an eukaryotic tumor in the host. We are exploring the use of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, as well as targeting bioactive lipid pathways, to discover potential inhibitors. (3) Cell-cell fusion and GPI-anchored proteins during skeletal myogenesis.  Secondary skeletal myogenesis, the process of differentiation of dividing, mononuclear myoblast into quiescent, multinucleate myotubes is critical for maintenance of skeletal muscle during aging and after injury.  GPI-anchored cell surface proteins appear to be critical for these regulated membrane-membrane fusion events.  Our research hopes to dissect the molecular choreography occurring at the site of opposing membranes which enables cell fusion.

1067182	Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are two bacterial pathogens that are very closely related, yet cause vastly different diseases in the mammalian host. Y. pestis is infamous for causing the devastating disease plague, while Y. pseudotuberculosis infection often results in a mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal illness. While genetically similar, the distinct mechanisms by which these two bacterial species interact with the host is of great interest to our group. Shared amongst both pathogens is a protein called Hfq, which serves as a chaperone for small, non-coding regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). One set of projects in the lab centers on understanding the post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by Hfq and sRNAs in both Yersinia species, particularly as they relate to virulence. We anticipate that the similarities and differences we identify between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis in this regard will provide keen insight into how a relatively mild pathogen evolved into one of the most deadly known to mankind. We are also interested in determining the mechanisms by which Y. pestis specifically causes primary pneumonic plague, a respiratory form of disease that Y. pseudotuberculosis does not produce. Another set of projects in the lab focuses on dissecting the mechanisms by which the Y. pestis virulence factor Pla controls the development of pneumonic plague. These include understanding the interaction of Y. pestis and Pla with the mammalian fibrinolytic and coagulation cascades, the identification of additional host substrates cleaved by Pla that lead to the development of a severe pneumonia, and the mechanisms by which Pla specifically induces an overwhelming inflammatory response in the lungs during infection.

1067418	Our lab is interested in studying signaling pathways that regulate cancer progression. One of our current projects looks at the role of the extracellular matrix protein, collagen, a major component of the fibrosis associated with pancreatic cancer, in promoting chemotherapy resistance. We have recently found that collagen up regulates expression of the matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (MMP14), which in turn induces expression of the chromatin modeling protein HMGA2. This results in pancreatic cancer cells escaping the proliferation arrest on gemcitabine treatment.

1068720	The overarching goal of our research is to improve upon current methods of bone healing.  In particular, we hope to develop more efficient and cost-effective methods of spine fusion that are associated with fewer adverse effects.  We utilize several different approaches to accomplish these goals. One research arm involves the use of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from human adipose tissue to elicit spine fusion in a point-of-care protocol.  In this research, we isolate mesenchymal stem cells from human liposuction aspirates and evaluate their capacityin conjunction with both standard and novel, nanotechnology-based carriersto elicit bone formation.  A second arm of our research utilizes a novel nanotechnology developed by our collaborator, Dr. Samuel Stupp, Director of the NU Institute for Bionanotechnology in Medicine (IBNAM).  Here, we employ a self-assembling, biodegradable nanogel composed of cylindrical nanofibers which contain an epitope directed at bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) in an attempt to facilitate spine fusion in our rat posterolateral spinal arthrodesis model.   Our research also focuses more broadly on mechanisms of bone healing.  In these studies, we investigate the molecular pathways by which normal bone healing occurs, as well as mechanisms by which these processes are disrupted, such as under osteoporotic conditions and after exposure to smoke and other environmental contaminants. Our goals are to elucidate these mechanisms of bone healing inhibition and develop novel methods to prevent such effects.
1068930	Cilia Polarity. The ability of ciliated epithelia to generate directed fluid flow is an important aspect of diverse developmental and physiological processes including proper respiratory function.  To achieve directed flow, ciliated cells must generate 100-200 cilia that are polarized along a common axis both within and between cells.  My lab is currently working towards understanding the molecular mechanisms for how cell polarity is coordinated as well as how individual cilia interpret the cells polarity.   Centriole Duplication. Centrioles are microtubule based structures with nine fold symmetry that are involved in both centrosome organization and aster formation during cell division.  During the normal cell cycle centrioles duplicate once, generating a mother / daughter pair, and in most post-mitotic vertebrate cells the mother centriole then goes on to form the basal body of a sensory cilium.  Abnormalities in the duplication of centrioles (and centrosomes) are prevalent in many cancers suggesting a link between centriole duplication and cancer progression.  My laboratory is addressing this fundamental question in cell biology from a novel direction with the use of Xenopus motile ciliated cells.  Ciliated cells are unique among vertebrate cells in that they naturally generate hundreds of centrioles therefore providing a great system for studying the regulation of centriole duplication.  Understanding how nature has overcome the typically tight regulation of centriole duplication will lend insight into the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression.

1069043	My research is to understand molecular mechanisms that govern the biological functions of the intracellular signaling network in both physiological and pathological events.  We focus on regulation of JNK, which is member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily.  JNK is activated by a MAP kinase module through sequential protein phosphorylation in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including proto-oncogens, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and physical stresses.  Once activated, JNK phosphorylates its cytoplasmic target proteins such as members of the Bcl-2 family proteins, Itch, tau, IRS-1, or its nuclear target proteins such as the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF2, Elk-1, Stat3 and p53, thereby controlling proliferation, differentiation, programmed death and transformation.  Not surprisingly, JNK is involved in the process of many human diseases including lung diseases and lung cancer.   Through its involvement in regulation of airway smooth muscle cell proliferation, cell death, myofibroblasts proliferation, cytokine synthesis and transformation, JNK is likely to play a critical role in asthma, ischemia/reperfusion damage, pulmonary fibrosis, allergic inflammation in lung and NSCLC.  However, the challenge is how to selectively modulate JNK activity in vivo.  We have evidence that JNK functions as a protein complex, i.e., the JNK signalsome that is composed of both known JNK activators and novel stimulus-dependent modulators or regulators (SMOR).  SMORs are selectively recruited to or dissociated from the JNK signalsome in a stimulus-dependent manner, thereby specifying the activation of JNK by various extracellular stimuli.  It is possible that one can target a unique SMOR to selectively regulate JNK activation by a specific stimulus without affecting JNK activation by other stimuli or affecting activation of other singling pathways by that stimulus.  Our study on the JNK signalsome should shed light on our understanding of the molecular mechanism of pulmonary diseases including lung cancer and provide potential therapeutic targets.

1069068	Retinoblastoma, the most common pediatric cancer of the eye, is a devastating and sometimes fatal pediatric cancer. Within the United States, the majority of retinoblastoma patients are diagnosed before their 2nd birthday, and many lose their sight due to this disease. Outside of the United States, advanced retinoblastoma is an even greater clinical challenge in developing countries, where the mortality rate among children diagnosed with advanced metastatic retinoblastoma is as high as 80%.     Our laboratory mission is to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with retinoblastoma progression in order to facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets.  We are accomplishing our mission by studying both genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during retinoblastoma progression in human retinoblastoma tumors, and in retinoblastoma model systems.  Defining these changes is particularly valuable for the purposes of identifying novel targets for chemotherapeutic interventions.

1069212	Stem cell dysfunction likely plays a central role in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases, particularly aging and cancer.  The use of simple eukaryotic model organisms in aging research has led to the identification and characterization of many genetic and environmental factors that modulate longevity.  The classic invertebrate model organisms, such as nematodes and fruit flies , however, are not ideal models for investigating the role of stem cells in human disease because of the relative absence of adult stem cells in these species.   My research program combines interests from my graduate research (stem cell biology) and postdoctoral work (basic biology of aging) using the freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, as a model system. Our goal is to establish S. mediterranea as a model for the study of aging and age-related disease, with emphasis on the role of stem cells in longevity. S. mediterranea represents an excellent model for investigating mechanisms of longevity because of their apparent immortality and remarkable capacity to repair and regenerate tissues .  Regeneration in planarians is due to the presence of neoblasts, a pluripotent stem cell population in the adult.   To investigate the relationship between stem cells and longevity, we are using known longevity determinants to characterize age-related phenotypes in planaria, paying particular attention to regeneration and tissue homeostasis. We are also investigating telomere homeostasis and it's role in stem cell function in planaria.  Together, these efforts will establish S. mediterranea as a powerful model for the study of aging and age-related disease, and bring new understanding into the role of stem cells in longevity.

1071785	The human immune system must be kept in a state of constant balance to remain healthy.  Elevated immune responses are needed to fight harmful pathogens, yet those responses have to be kept from overreacting and attacking the bodys normal tissues.  A complex mix of immune cells is known to influence this balance.  My research interest is to understand the crosstalk among different cell types, especially focusing on two types of immune cells, Th17 cells and Treg cells, in the maintenance of immune homeostasis.  Our laboratory is studying the molecular mechanisms by which different transcription factors influence the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells, and examine the Th17-Treg balance in immunity and autoimmune diseases using a combination of molecular, cellular and mouse genetic approaches.

1071859	Parkinson's disease results from the degeneration and frank loss of dopamine-releasing neurons in the substantia nigra. Interestingly, a nearby population of dopamine-releasing neurons in the ventral tegmental area remains unaffected by this degenerative process.  Recent studies have suggested that this degenerative process, and the onset of Parkinson's disease, are preceded by a similar process that takes place in other brain regions, wherein only a particular class of neurons is affected while others are spared. I am interested in understanding whether there is a common mechanism underlying the selective nature of these neurodegenerative processes. A hypothesis put forward by Dr. D. James Surmeier points to a common property shared by the various neurons that degenerate. They are all perpetually active neurons whose output is necessary for basic physiological functions carried out by such systems as the cardiovascular system or the gastrointestinal tract. According to this hypothesis the ongoing activity of these cells comes at a metabolic cost leading to their premature 'aging' and death. In particular I am studying the machinery that enables neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, that innervate the heart and the GI tract, to maintain their perpetual activity, and how this may cause them to be particularly vulnerable to neurodegeneration.  My research combines neurophysiological techniques, live cell imaging, molecular biological tools and computational modeling. Additional interests: 1. the cellular basis for the role played by cholinergic interneurons of the striatum, in health where their activity comprises a neural correlate of classical conditioning, and in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease where their release of acetylcholine is upregulated. 2. The biophysics underlying collective dynamics of perpetually active neurons. 3. Design and development of electrodes for functional electrostimulation. 4. Deep brain stimulation.

1072154	My lab focuses on how genetic and epigenetic modulators promote the development and maintenance of adult stem cells. Microenvironments, or niches, support the maintenance of stem cells and facilitate the development of tumors through largely unknown mechanisms. Cell-autonomous genetic pathways and epigenetic networks have emerged as important determinants for the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells in embryonic, juvenile, and adult issues. The importance of non-cell autonomous genetic and epigenetic factors is less well established. Our goal is to identify and characterize the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms utilized by both stem cells and their surrounding niche in supporting the stem cell program. For these studies, the developing mouse testis is used to examine interactions between male germline stem cells (GSCs) and their somatic niche.

1072968	The goal of my research is to understand the molecular basis by which animals and their natural microbiota form specific, reproducible interactions. Microbial symbioses are prevalent in animal biology, and often, as in the case of humans, the animal host is born devoid of its natural symbionts and must acquire microbial partners from the environment. Pathogenic and beneficial bacteria share common mechanisms by which they colonize animal tissue. In spite of these parallels, relatively little work has been accorded to the beneficial associations, which are widespread, and critical to the lifecycles of both the bacterial and animal partners. I am studying the natural association between Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid to understand the processes that underlie host colonization in animal-associated bacteria. The system is particularly amenable to studying microbe-host interactions because V. fischeri is the only bacterial resident of the squid's light organ, and we seek to understand how V. fischeri specifically colonizes the host to the exclusion of other species. Each generation, the squid hatch without their microbial partners and must selectively recruit V. fischeri from the ocean. We use a combination of bacterial genetics and imaging to identify how the animal and bacteria communicate to reproducibly establish this productive relationship.

1080111	Research Interests: Our laboratory concentrates its efforts into the investigation of the mechanistic connection between aging, cellular and/or mitochondrial metabolism, and carcinogenesis focusing on the Sirtuin gene family. To address this idea, over the past five years, we have constructed mice that have the three primary (Sirt1-3) sirtuins genetically deleted.  The mice that lack Sirt1 (Wang et al., 2009, Cancer Cell), Sirt2 (Kim et al., 2011, Cancer Cell), and Sirt3 (Kim et al., 2010, Cancer Cell) each develop breast cancer, as well as other types of malignancies to varying degrees, and the levels of SIRT1-3 are also decreased in human cancer samples, as compared to normal tissues.  In addition, the mechanism connecting the tumor permissive phenotype and the aberrant regulation of mitochondrial ROS, at least in part, in the Sirt3 knockout mouse has recently been published (Tao et al., 2010, Molecular Cell).  Thus, based on these results it seems clear that the primary sirtuin deacetylase proteins are tumor suppressor in several breast cancers as well as to a lesser extent in several other human malignancies.  These results seemed logical, since human sirtuins are the human homologs for the yeast and C. elegans longevity genes, and breast cancers have one of the strongest correlations to age.  Thus, it is proposed that the primary sirtuin family knockout mice may present a novel group of models to establish, validate, and investigate the well established connection between aging, metabolism, and cancer.  These murine models are also used to pursue the laboratories interest and the identification and validation of chemopreventative agents and we currently have a DOD and R01 grants to pursue this for luminal B breast malignancies.  Finally, the laboratory has a series of murine in vivo and in vitro models to mechanistically connect Sirt2 and Sirt3 to cancers of the breast, pancreas, liver, and lung that are currently be used.

Drug therapy is more than just drugs, it includes the instructions for safely and effectively using the drugs and the resources to support those instructions (e.g., nurses, pharmacists, physicians, infusion pumps, and drug concentration measurements).  A prescription is a health-care program implemented by a physician or other qualified practitioner in the form of instructions that govern the plan of care for an individual patient. Working with a team of investigators, I showed that application of computer programming design and debugging methods results in a marked increase in the safety of opioid prescriptions in hospitalized adults. The methods we have developed in pharmacoalgorithmics have application to reducing the risk of adverse drug events, optimizing the efficacy of drug therapy, and reducing the cost of medical care.

2206725	Prolactin and Breast Cancer<BR><BR> The research focus in Dr. Clevengers lab is the characterization of prolactin (PRL) receptor signal transduction and function as it relates to breast cancer and mammary gland development. The PRL receptor (PRLr) is a member of the growth factor/cytokine receptor family, which includes the receptors for interleukin 2-7, GM-CSF, EPO, and GH. Within humans, PRL functions at the endocrine and autocrine/paracrine levels as a growth, differentiation, and motility factor within the breast, a hypothesis first postulated by our laboratory. Therefore, one of our major aims is the characterization of those mechanisms that regulate PRL/PRLr expression and action in both normal and neoplastic tissues. PRL action in human tissues is mediated by the PRLr. The molecular dissection of PRLr isoform structure/function is a research focus, utilizing both biochemical and biophysical approaches to examine PRL-PRLr binding and the interaction of the PRLr with its associated transduction pathways that include JAK/Stat, Nek3/Vav2/Rac, Fyn, SIRPa, NFAT, and c-myb. We have also recently identified a direct genomic action of PRL on gene expression. This action is mediated by the prolyl isomerase cyclophilin B (CypB), which retrotransports endocytosed ligand into the nucleus, where the PRL/CypB complex directly interacts with and activates the Stat5 transcription factor. Additional research by our lab on prolyl isomerases has found that cyclophilin A (CypA) is required for proximal PRLr transduction, functioning as the molecular switch facilitating ligand-induced conformational change of the PRLr enabling Jak2 activation. As such our findings present vantage points in the development of novel therapies aimed at modulating PRL action during the differentiation of the human breast and the pathogenesis of malignancy in this tissue.

2238574	My research program concerns understanding principles of human motivation and applying those principles toward helping people make healthy choices.  In particular, my research is currently focused on developing more effective interventions for increasing physical activity, eating healthier, and for weight management in general.   One common feature of my research involves differentiating autonomous and controlled forms of motivation based on a self-determination theory framework. And I am especially interested in interventions that support a subset of autonomous motivation known as intrinsic motivation, a subcategory characterized by interest and enjoyment. My research program is currently exploring ways to leverage technology (e.g., smartphone apps & accelerometry), game design, social networks, choice, and financial incentives in ways that support autonomous motivation and lasting behavior change.  An underlying principle is that, if we can help people to value or even enjoy healthy behaviors, healthy changes will tend to come more easily and be more easily maintained. Another complimentary feature of this research program involves my orientation toward collaboration and crossdisciplinary team science.  Compelling empirical evidence suggests that, when done well, team science is more creative, more impactful, and more fun; and Ive found support for these principles in my experience, as well. You can find more information and training tools for crossdisciplinary researchers at TeamScience.net, a website co-developed with Drs. Spring, Falk-Krzesinski, and the team at NogginLabs, Inc.
2245338	My research falls under the broad umbrella of aging and dementia and uses a multimodal approach to investigate two aging perspectives: primary progressive aphasia (PPA) in which neurodegenerative disease invades the language network and SuperAging in which individuals are seemingly resistant to the deleterious changes in memory associated with normal or more typical cognitive aging. My investigations have provided new fundamental knowledge with translational implications for cognitive aging, dementia, and neurodegenerative disease as well as the cognitive neuroscience of language and memory. Since joining the faculty at the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimers disease Center (CNADC) at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in 2008, I have led the neuroimaging arm of our NIDCD funded Language in PPA R01 project and the cognitive and neuroimaging arm of the SuperAging study. While structural neuroimaging is my primary method of investigation it is not the only tool I use. My other investigations have explored the role of genetic, developmental and acquired factors in aging and dementia, which demonstrates my capacity to collect and integrate multidisciplinary data. I have a successful history of funding and recently received R01 funding from the NINDS to examine the relationship between clinical decline, brain atrophy and putative underlying pathology using PET amyloid imaging.
2247422	Dr. Matic's research in therapeutic biomedical optics has involved lasers for skin incisions, low-level irradiation of periodontal bacteria and, most recently, optical stimulation of the cochlea.  She is a leading expert in the field of pulsed infrared neural stimulation (INS) and is currently studying INS in the auditory system to improve cochlear implants.  Currently, the function of cochlear implants is limited, in part, by the spread of electric current in the cochlea and, therefore, the restored hearing and speech perception to cochlear implant users is less than ideal.  Lasers can stimulate smaller populations of neurons than conventional electrical stimulation, likely improving the users' speech perception.  We are working towards a novel cochlear implant built on optical technology.  Dr. Matic is also interested in further therapeutic uses of biomedical optics in otolaryngology, and other intersections of optics and neurophysiology/neural engineering.  Dr. Matic received her B.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Vanderbilt University and her M.S. and Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Northwestern University.

2305553	Dr. Jensen has a strong research interest in biopsychosocial relationships in the context of medical illness and treatment.  Dr. Jensen has extensive training and experience in research focused on the interrelationships between psychosocial functioning, neuroendocrine/immune functioning, physical symptom onset, and patient-reported outcomes in oncologic and gynecologic surgery. This line of research is grounded in the hope that a better understanding of the relationships between psychosocial functioning and surgical outcome may help to identify optimal surgical candidates, identify biological mechanisms by which psychosocial functioning may affect health outcomes, and lead to the development of future interventions to improve psychosocial functioning and surgical outcomes. Dr. Jensen is increasingly interested in exploring the relationships between psychosocial functioning, physical symptoms, and medical decision-making with respect to innovative surgical and non-surgical treatments among other populations, including candidates for transplant surgery, candidates for reconstructive surgery, and individuals with upper limb amputations.

2564425	My research interest is fetal programming and the identification of infants and children at high risk of developing childhood-onset obesity. My long-term goal is to facilitate early intervention to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2573125	My main interest has been the investigation of mechanisms of regulation of aggressive behavior in peditaric solid tumors with focus on Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors, by exploring tissue biomarkers in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. My purpose has been to integrate pathological, clinical and molecular data in order to disclose diagnostic signatures and to discover novel targets for therapy development.  My effort takes advantage of my skills as a pediatric oncological pathologist. It includes the exploration of main processes, molecular networks and signaling pathways involved in the different aspects of these entities employing tools such as high throughput cDNA/miRNAs expression profiling and immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays. To achieve my goals I have been establishing collaborations with major national and international biorepositories and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams of experts.
2575033	I am interested in the area of vitamin D and its many connections to human diseases and well being.  Taking advantage of an existing twin cohort aged 6-21 years (~2000 pairs) initially enrolled in 1998-2000 in Anqing, China, my project focuses on elucidating the longitudinal relationship of vitamin D status with known risk factors or biomarkers for metabolic syndrome (MS) in children and adolescents using a prospective co-twin design.  Relevant data from this cohort of pre-adolescent and adolescent subjects will be evaluated to test several hypotheses related to MS risk factors and biomarkers. I foresee that my research on vitamin D and human diseases will not only influence clinical and public health practice, but also contribute to policy discussions about diet and exercise in schools, the built environment, and vitamin D fortification in general populations.
2626307	My research focuses on measuring and reducing the use of low-value health care services in order to improve quality and decrease cost of health care.
2628248	I am interested in global cardiovascular health, epidemiology, outcomes, and prevention research with a particular emphasis on India.  I collaborate with a terrific mentor in New Delhi, Dr. D. Prabhakaran, who is the Executive Director of the Centre for Chronic Disease Control (ccdcindia.org) on several projects, including my NIH/NHLBI-supported K99/R00 Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement in Kerala cluster randomized, stepped wedge clinical trial.  We are developing a quality improvement toolkit with cardiologists from Kerala to improve acute coronary syndrome outcomes through the Cardiological Society of India-Kerala Chapter, led by Dr. P.P. Mohanan from Westfort Hi-Tech Hospital in Thrissur.  I also work closely with my Northwestern mentor, Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones (K99/R00 co-mentor) in evaluating past and future trends in cardiovascular health using nationally representative US data in collaboration with Drs. Darwin Labarthe and Hongyan Ning (Northwestern), Professor Simon Capewell (University of Liverpool), and Dr. Earl Ford (CDC).  We have applied these projections to Prof. Capewell's IMPACT Coronary Heart Disease Policy model to evaluate future projections in coronary heart disease mortality based on plausible scenarios.  I have also begun performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the role of statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and the efficacy of a polypill for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease as a member of the Cochrane Heart Group editorial board.
2697988	I am interested in neonatal lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. Within this, my focus is basic/translational and clinical research in the study of cellular and molecular pathways underlying hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension, with the end goal of development of targeted preventative and therapeutic strategies.
2698074	I am interested in the initial interactions between the endothelium, pathogens, and innate immunity, interactions that initiate the inflammatory and coagulation cascades.  My current project uses the pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi, and aims to elucidate how the parasite interacts with and breaches the endothelial barrier. Defining T. cruzi interactions with the endothelium and the ensuing escape from the vasculature may reveal novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of the clinical sequelae of infection, as well as lend insight into the pathogens apparent tropism for specific tissues.  Elucidation of the mechanisms that enable pathogens to migrate across the endothelial barrier will also contribute to the broader understanding of endothelial permeability and its role in critical illness.
2698325	I am interested in the development and assessment of educational curricula, especially at the graduate medical level.  I use simulation often in these curricula to teach medical management, team communication and leadership skills.
2698352	My primary clinical interests include general pediatric gastroenterology, short bowel syndrome, and obesity.
2698369	I am a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Healthcare Studies pursing a Masters in Health Service and Outcomes Research with a focus in pre-hospital medicine.  My interests include prehospital cardiac arrest and mass gathering medicine.  I have also studied palliative medicine topics in the Emergency Department setting.
